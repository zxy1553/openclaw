  - You want shorter `exec` or `bash` tool results in OpenClaw
  - You want to install or enable the Tokenjuice plugin
  - You need to understand what tokenjuice changes and what it leaves raw
---

`tokenjuice` is an optional external plugin that compacts noisy `exec` and `bash`
tool results after the command has already run.

It changes the returned `tool_result`, not the command itself. Tokenjuice does
not rewrite shell input, rerun commands, or change exit codes.

Today this applies to OpenClaw embedded runs and OpenClaw dynamic tools in the Codex
app-server harness. Tokenjuice hooks OpenClaw's tool-result middleware and
trims the output before it goes back into the active harness session.

## Enable the plugin

Install once:

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@openclaw/tokenjuice
```

Then enable it:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tokenjuice.enabled true
```

Equivalent:

```bash
openclaw plugins enable tokenjuice
```

If you prefer editing config directly:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      tokenjuice: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## What tokenjuice changes

- Compacts noisy `exec` and `bash` results before they are fed back into the session.
- Keeps the original command execution untouched.
- Preserves exact file-content reads and other commands that tokenjuice should leave raw.
- Stays opt-in: disable the plugin if you want verbatim output everywhere.

## Verify it is working

1. Enable the plugin.
2. Start a session that can call `exec`.
3. Run a noisy command such as `git status`.
4. Check that the returned tool result is shorter and more structured than the raw shell output.

## Disable the plugin

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tokenjuice.enabled false
```

Or:

```bash
openclaw plugins disable tokenjuice
```

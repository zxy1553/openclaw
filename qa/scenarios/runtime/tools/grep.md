# Grep runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-grep
title: Runtime tool fixture — grep
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.grep
objective: Verify grep-style search behavior is tracked through command execution while Codex owns exec/process natively.
successCriteria:
  - OpenClaw may expose OpenClaw exec while Codex app-server mode may omit duplicate OpenClaw dynamic exec/process.
  - Mock provider exec plans are reported as fixture intent, not as actual runtime tool calls.
  - The row stays report-only until the fixture validates native Codex search/command behavior directly.

  summary: Exercise grep coverage through the current exec tool surface.

    toolName: exec

      action: split native search/command behavior from OpenClaw dynamic tool parity
      reason: Codex app-server intentionally owns command execution natively; current OpenClaw coding surface routes grep-style searches through exec.
    knownHarnessGap:
      issue: "#80319"
      reason: QA tool-defaults currently needs native search/command behavior coverage instead of OpenClaw dynamic exec exposure.

OpenClaw projects are not toy demos. People are shipping PR review loops, mobile apps, home automation, voice systems, devtools, and memory-heavy workflows from the channels they already use — chat-native builds on Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and terminals; real automation for booking, shopping, and support without waiting for an API; and physical-world integrations with printers, vacuums, cameras, and home systems.

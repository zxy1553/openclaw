# `openclaw sessions`

List stored conversation sessions.

Session lists are not channel/provider liveness checks. They show persisted
conversation rows from session stores. A quiet Discord, Slack, Telegram, or
other channel can reconnect successfully without creating a new session row
until a message is processed. Use `openclaw channels status --probe`,
`openclaw status --deep`, or `openclaw health --verbose` when you need live
channel connectivity.

`openclaw sessions` and Gateway `sessions.list` responses are bounded by
default so large long-lived stores cannot monopolize the CLI process or Gateway
event loop. The CLI returns the newest 100 sessions by default; pass
`--limit <n>` for a smaller/larger window or `--limit all` when you intentionally
need the full store. JSON responses include `totalCount`, `limitApplied`, and
`hasMore` when callers need to show that more rows exist.

RPC clients can pass `configuredAgentsOnly: true` to keep the broad combined
discovery source but return only rows for agents currently present in config.
Control UI uses that mode by default so deleted or disk-only agent stores do
not reappear in the Sessions view.

```bash
openclaw sessions
openclaw sessions --agent work
openclaw sessions --all-agents
openclaw sessions --active 120
openclaw sessions --limit 25
openclaw sessions --verbose
openclaw sessions --json
```

Scope selection:

- default: configured default agent store
- `--verbose`: verbose logging
- `--agent <id>`: one configured agent store
- `--all-agents`: aggregate all configured agent stores
- `--store <path>`: explicit store path (cannot be combined with `--agent` or `--all-agents`)
- `--limit <n|all>`: max rows to output (default `100`; `all` restores full output)

Tail human-readable trajectory progress for stored sessions:

```bash
openclaw sessions tail
openclaw sessions tail --follow
openclaw sessions tail --session-key "agent:main:telegram:direct:123" --tail 25
openclaw sessions --agent work tail --follow
openclaw sessions --all-agents tail --follow
```

`openclaw sessions tail` renders recent trajectory JSONL events as compact progress lines. Without `--session-key`, it tails running sessions first, then the latest stored session. `--tail <count>` controls how many existing events print before follow mode; the default is `80`, and `0` starts at the current end. `--follow` keeps watching the selected trajectory files, including relocated files referenced by `<session>.trajectory-path.json`.

The progress view is intentionally conservative: prompt text, tool arguments, and tool result bodies are not printed. Tool calls show the tool name with `{...redacted...}`; tool results show status such as `ok`, `error`, or `done`; model completion lines show provider/model and terminal status.

Export a trajectory bundle for a stored session:

```bash
openclaw sessions export-trajectory --session-key "agent:main:telegram:direct:123" --workspace .
openclaw sessions export-trajectory --session-key "agent:main:telegram:direct:123" --output bug-123 --json
```

This is the command path used by the `/export-trajectory` slash command after
the owner approves the exec request. The output directory is always resolved
inside `.openclaw/trajectory-exports/` under the selected workspace.

`openclaw sessions --all-agents` reads configured agent stores. Gateway and ACP
session discovery are broader: they also include disk-only stores found under
the default `agents/` root or a templated `session.store` root. Those
discovered stores must resolve to regular `sessions.json` files inside the
agent root; symlinks and out-of-root paths are skipped.

JSON examples:

`openclaw sessions --all-agents --json`:

```json
{
  "path": null,
  "stores": [
    { "agentId": "main", "path": "/home/user/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json" },
    { "agentId": "work", "path": "/home/user/.openclaw/agents/work/sessions/sessions.json" }
  ],
  "allAgents": true,
  "count": 2,
  "totalCount": 2,
  "limitApplied": 100,
  "hasMore": false,
  "activeMinutes": null,
  "sessions": [
    { "agentId": "main", "key": "agent:main:main", "model": "gpt-5" },
    { "agentId": "work", "key": "agent:work:main", "model": "claude-opus-4-6" }
  ]
}
```

## Cleanup maintenance

Run maintenance now (instead of waiting for the next write cycle):

```bash
openclaw sessions cleanup --dry-run
openclaw sessions cleanup --agent work --dry-run
openclaw sessions cleanup --all-agents --dry-run
openclaw sessions cleanup --enforce
openclaw sessions cleanup --enforce --active-key "agent:main:telegram:direct:123"
openclaw sessions cleanup --dry-run --fix-dm-scope
openclaw sessions cleanup --json
```

`openclaw sessions cleanup` uses `session.maintenance` settings from config:

- Scope note: `openclaw sessions cleanup` maintains session stores, transcripts, and trajectory sidecars. It does not prune cron run history, which is managed by `cron.runLog.keepLines` in [Cron configuration](/automation/cron-jobs#configuration) and explained in [Cron maintenance](/automation/cron-jobs#maintenance).
- Cleanup also prunes unreferenced primary transcripts, compaction checkpoints, and trajectory sidecars older than `session.maintenance.pruneAfter`; files still referenced by `sessions.json` are preserved.

- `--dry-run`: preview how many entries would be pruned/capped without writing.
  - In text mode, dry-run prints a per-session action table (`Action`, `Key`, `Age`, `Model`, `Flags`) so you can see what would be kept vs removed.
- `--enforce`: apply maintenance even when `session.maintenance.mode` is `warn`.
- `--fix-missing`: remove entries whose transcript files are missing or header-only/empty, even if they would not normally age/count out yet.
- `--fix-dm-scope`: when `session.dmScope` is `main`, retire stale peer-keyed direct-DM rows left behind by earlier `per-peer`, `per-channel-peer`, or `per-account-channel-peer` routing. Use `--dry-run` first; applying the cleanup removes those rows from `sessions.json` and preserves their transcripts as deleted archives.
- `--active-key <key>`: protect a specific active key from disk-budget eviction. Durable external conversation pointers, such as group sessions and thread-scoped chat sessions, are also kept by age/count/disk-budget maintenance.
- `--agent <id>`: run cleanup for one configured agent store.
- `--all-agents`: run cleanup for all configured agent stores.
- `--store <path>`: run against a specific `sessions.json` file.
- `--json`: print a JSON summary. With `--all-agents`, output includes one summary per store.

When a Gateway is reachable, non-dry-run cleanup for configured agent stores is
sent through the Gateway so it shares the same session-store writer as runtime
traffic. Use `--store <path>` for explicit offline repair of a store file.

`openclaw sessions cleanup --all-agents --dry-run --json`:

```json
{
  "allAgents": true,
  "mode": "warn",
  "dryRun": true,
  "stores": [
    {
      "agentId": "main",
      "storePath": "/home/user/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json",
      "beforeCount": 120,
      "afterCount": 80,
      "missing": 0,
      "dmScopeRetired": 0,
      "pruned": 40,
      "capped": 0
    },
    {
      "agentId": "work",
      "storePath": "/home/user/.openclaw/agents/work/sessions/sessions.json",
      "beforeCount": 18,
      "afterCount": 18,
      "missing": 0,
      "dmScopeRetired": 0,
      "pruned": 0,
      "capped": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

# OpenClaw docs i18n assets

This folder stores translation config for the source docs repo.

Generated locale trees and live translation memory now live in the publish repo:

- repo: `openclaw/docs`
- local checkout: `~/Projects/openclaw-docs`

## Source of truth

- English docs are authored in `openclaw/openclaw`.
- The source docs tree lives under `docs/`.
- The source repo no longer keeps committed generated locale trees such as `docs/zh-CN/**`, `docs/zh-TW/**`, `docs/ja-JP/**`, `docs/es/**`, `docs/pt-BR/**`, `docs/ko/**`, `docs/de/**`, `docs/fr/**`, `docs/ar/**`, `docs/it/**`, `docs/vi/**`, `docs/nl/**`, `docs/fa/**`, `docs/tr/**`, `docs/uk/**`, `docs/id/**`, `docs/pl/**`, or `docs/th/**`.

## End-to-end flow

1. Edit English docs in `openclaw/openclaw`.
2. Push to `main`.
3. `openclaw/openclaw/.github/workflows/docs-sync-publish.yml` mirrors the docs tree into `openclaw/docs`.
4. The sync script rewrites the publish `docs/docs.json` so the generated locale picker blocks exist there even though they are no longer committed in the source repo.
5. `openclaw/docs/.github/workflows/translate-all.yml` waits for `main` to settle, translates only stale or missing locale pages, and uploads per-locale artifacts.
6. The publish repo finalizer applies successful locale artifacts and pushes one aggregate `chore(i18n): refresh translations` commit.
7. A weekly `full` run reconciles every locale/page path so flaky model failures are retried without making hot docs commits wait.

## Why the split exists

- Keep generated locale output out of the main product repo.
- Keep Mintlify on a single published docs tree.
- Preserve the built-in language switcher for Mintlify-supported generated locales by letting the publish repo own generated locale trees.
- Keep generated Thai (`th`) and Persian (`fa`) docs plus translation memory even though Mintlify does not currently accept those codes in `navigation.languages`. Their absence from the built-in docs language picker is a host limitation, not a failed translation run.

## Locale visibility

- Control UI supports `en`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `pt-BR`, `de`, `es`, `ja-JP`, `ko`, `fr`, `ar`, `it`, `tr`, `uk`, `id`, `pl`, `th`, `vi`, `nl`, and `fa`.
- Docs translation workflows generate the same non-English locale set in `openclaw/docs`.
- The Mintlify docs language picker can expose only the locales accepted by Mintlify `navigation.languages`; today that includes Vietnamese (`vi`) and Dutch (`nl`), but not Thai (`th`) or Persian (`fa`).
- Do not treat missing `th` or `fa` entries in generated `docs/docs.json` as a pipeline failure. Verify their generated folders in `openclaw/docs` instead.

## Files in this folder

- `glossary.<lang>.json` — preferred term mappings used as prompt guidance.
- `zh-Hans-navigation.json` — curated zh-Hans Mintlify locale navigation reinserted into the publish repo during sync.
- `ar-navigation.json`, `de-navigation.json`, `es-navigation.json`, `fr-navigation.json`, `id-navigation.json`, `it-navigation.json`, `ja-navigation.json`, `ko-navigation.json`, `pl-navigation.json`, `pt-BR-navigation.json`, and `tr-navigation.json` — starter locale metadata kept alongside the source repo, but the publish sync now clones the full English nav tree for clone-en locales so translated pages are visible in Mintlify without hand-maintaining per-locale nav JSON.
- `<lang>.tm.jsonl` — translation memory keyed by workflow + model + text hash.

In this repo, generated locale TM files such as `docs/.i18n/zh-CN.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/zh-TW.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/ja-JP.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/es.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/pt-BR.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/ko.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/de.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/fr.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/ar.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/it.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/vi.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/nl.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/fa.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/tr.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/uk.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/id.tm.jsonl`, `docs/.i18n/pl.tm.jsonl`, and `docs/.i18n/th.tm.jsonl` are intentionally no longer committed.

## Glossary format

`glossary.<lang>.json` is an array of entries:

```json
{
  "source": "troubleshooting",
  "target": "故障排除"
}
```

Fields:

- `source`: English (or source) phrase to prefer.
- `target`: preferred translation output.

## Translation mechanics

- `scripts/docs-i18n` still owns translation generation.
- Doc mode writes `x-i18n.source_hash` into each translated page.
- The publish workflow precomputes a pending file list by comparing the current English source hash to the stored locale `x-i18n.source_hash`.
- If the pending count is `0`, the expensive translation step is skipped entirely.
- If there are pending files, the workflow translates only those files.
- Locale workers retry transient model-format failures, but unchanged files stay skipped because the same hash check runs on each retry.
- Locale workers upload artifacts; the publish repo finalizer commits all successful locale outputs together.
- Published GitHub releases dispatch one aggregate translation refresh so release docs can catch up without waiting for the weekly reconciliation.

## Operational notes

- Sync metadata is written to `.openclaw-sync/source.json` in the publish repo.
- Source repo secret: `OPENCLAW_DOCS_SYNC_TOKEN`
- Publish repo secret: `OPENCLAW_DOCS_I18N_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- If locale output looks stale, check the `Translate All` workflow in `openclaw/docs` first.

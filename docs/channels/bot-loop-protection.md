# Bot loop protection

OpenClaw can accept messages written by other bots on channels that support `allowBots`.
When that path is enabled, pair loop protection prevents two bot identities from
replying to each other indefinitely.

The guard is enforced by the core inbound reply runner. Each supporting channel
maps its own inbound event into generic facts: account or scope, conversation id,
sender bot id, and receiver bot id. Core then tracks the participant pair in both
directions, applies a sliding-window budget, and suppresses the pair during a
cooldown after the budget is exceeded.

## Defaults

Pair loop protection is active when a channel lets bot-authored messages reach
dispatch. Built-in defaults are:

- `maxEventsPerWindow: 20` - a bot pair can exchange 20 events within the window
- `windowSeconds: 60` - sliding window length
- `cooldownSeconds: 60` - suppression time after the pair exceeds the budget

The guard does not affect normal human-authored messages, single-bot deployments,
self-message filtering, or one-shot bot replies that stay under the budget.

## Configure shared defaults

Set `channels.defaults.botLoopProtection` once to give every supporting channel
the same baseline. Channel and account overrides can still tune individual
surfaces.

```json5
{
  channels: {
    defaults: {
      botLoopProtection: {
        maxEventsPerWindow: 20,
        windowSeconds: 60,
        cooldownSeconds: 60,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Set `enabled: false` only when your channel policy intentionally allows
bot-to-bot conversations without automatic suppression.

## Override per channel or account

Supporting channels layer their own config over the shared default. Precedence is:

- `channels.<channel>.<room-or-space>.botLoopProtection`, when the channel supports per-conversation overrides
- `channels.<channel>.accounts.<account>.botLoopProtection`, when the channel supports accounts
- `channels.<channel>.botLoopProtection`, when the channel supports top-level defaults
- `channels.defaults.botLoopProtection`
- built-in defaults

```json5
{
  channels: {
    defaults: {
      botLoopProtection: {
        maxEventsPerWindow: 20,
      },
    },
    discord: {
      botLoopProtection: {
        maxEventsPerWindow: 8,
      },
      accounts: {
        molty: {
          allowBots: "mentions",
          botLoopProtection: {
            maxEventsPerWindow: 5,
            cooldownSeconds: 90,
          },
        },
      },
    },
    slack: {
      allowBots: "mentions",
      botLoopProtection: {
        maxEventsPerWindow: 8,
      },
    },
    matrix: {
      allowBots: "mentions",
      groups: {
        "!roomid:example.org": {
          botLoopProtection: {
            maxEventsPerWindow: 5,
          },
        },
      },
    },
    googlechat: {
      allowBots: true,
      groups: {
        "spaces/AAAA": {
          botLoopProtection: {
            maxEventsPerWindow: 5,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Channel support

- Discord: native `author.bot` facts, keyed by Discord account, channel, and bot pair.
- Slack: native `bot_id` facts for accepted bot-authored messages, keyed by Slack account, channel, and bot pair.
- Matrix: configured Matrix bot accounts, keyed by Matrix account, room, and configured bot pair.
- Google Chat: native `sender.type=BOT` facts for accepted bot-authored messages, keyed by account, space, and bot pair.

Channels that do not expose a reliable inbound bot identity keep using their
normal self-message and access-policy filters. They should not opt into this
guard until they can identify both participants in the bot pair.

See [SDK runtime](/plugins/sdk-runtime#reusable-runtime-utilities) for plugin
implementation details.

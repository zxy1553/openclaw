OpenClaw has moved from a broad backwards-compatibility layer to a modern plugin
architecture with focused, documented imports. If your plugin was built before
the new architecture, this guide helps you migrate.

## What is changing

The old plugin system provided two wide-open surfaces that let plugins import
anything they needed from a single entry point:

- **`openclaw/plugin-sdk/compat`** - a single import that re-exported dozens of
  helpers. It was introduced to keep older hook-based plugins working while the
  new plugin architecture was being built.
- **`openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime`** - a broad runtime helper barrel that
  mixed system events, heartbeat state, delivery queues, fetch/proxy helpers,
  file helpers, approval types, and unrelated utilities.
- **`openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-runtime`** - a broad config compatibility barrel
  that still carries deprecated direct load/write helpers during the migration
  window.
- **`openclaw/extension-api`** - a bridge that gave plugins direct access to
  host-side helpers like the embedded agent runner.
- **`api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory(...)`** - a removed embedded-runner-only bundled
  extension hook that could observe embedded-runner events such as
  `tool_result`.

The broad import surfaces are now **deprecated**. They still work at runtime,
but new plugins must not use them, and existing plugins should migrate before
the next major release removes them. The embedded-runner-only extension factory
registration API has been removed; use tool-result middleware instead.

OpenClaw does not remove or reinterpret documented plugin behavior in the same
change that introduces a replacement. Breaking contract changes must first go
through a compatibility adapter, diagnostics, docs, and a deprecation window.
That applies to SDK imports, manifest fields, setup APIs, hooks, and runtime
registration behavior.

<Warning>
  The backwards-compatibility layer will be removed in a future major release.
  Plugins that still import from these surfaces will break when that happens.
  Legacy embedded extension factory registrations already no longer load.
</Warning>

## Why this changed

The old approach caused problems:

- **Slow startup** - importing one helper loaded dozens of unrelated modules
- **Circular dependencies** - broad re-exports made it easy to create import cycles
- **Unclear API surface** - no way to tell which exports were stable vs internal

The modern plugin SDK fixes this: each import path (`openclaw/plugin-sdk/\<subpath\>`)
is a small, self-contained module with a clear purpose and documented contract.

Legacy provider convenience seams for bundled channels are also gone.
Channel-branded helper seams were private mono-repo shortcuts, not stable
plugin contracts. Use narrow generic SDK subpaths instead. Inside the bundled
plugin workspace, keep provider-owned helpers in that plugin's own `api.ts` or
`runtime-api.ts`.

Current bundled provider examples:

- Anthropic keeps Claude-specific stream helpers in its own `api.ts` /
  `contract-api.ts` seam
- OpenAI keeps provider builders, default-model helpers, and realtime provider
  builders in its own `api.ts`
- OpenRouter keeps provider builder and onboarding/config helpers in its own
  `api.ts`

## Talk and realtime voice migration plan

Realtime voice, telephony, meeting, and browser Talk code is moving from
surface-local turn bookkeeping to a shared Talk session controller exported by
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/realtime-voice`. The new controller owns the common Talk
event envelope, active turn state, capture state, output-audio state, recent
event history, and stale-turn rejection. Provider plugins should keep owning
vendor-specific realtime sessions; surface plugins should keep owning capture,
playback, telephony, and meeting quirks.

This Talk migration is intentionally breaking-clean:

1. Keep the shared controller/runtime primitives in
   `plugin-sdk/realtime-voice`.
2. Move bundled surfaces onto the shared controller: browser relay,
   managed-room handoff, voice-call realtime, voice-call streaming STT, Google
   Meet realtime, and native push-to-talk.
3. Replace old Talk RPC families with the final `talk.session.*` and
   `talk.client.*` API.
4. Advertise one live Talk event channel in Gateway
   `hello-ok.features.events`: `talk.event`.
5. Delete the old realtime HTTP endpoint and any request-time instruction
   override path.

New code should not call `createTalkEventSequencer(...)` directly unless it is
implementing a low-level adapter or test fixture. Prefer the shared controller
so turn-scoped events cannot be emitted without a turn id, stale `turnEnd` /
`turnCancel` calls cannot clear a newer active turn, and output-audio lifecycle
events stay consistent across telephony, meetings, browser relay, managed-room
handoff, and native Talk clients.

The target public API shape is:

```typescript
// Gateway-owned Talk session API.
await gateway.request("talk.session.create", {
  mode: "realtime",
  transport: "gateway-relay",
  brain: "agent-consult",
  sessionKey: "main",
});
await gateway.request("talk.session.appendAudio", { sessionId, audioBase64 });
await gateway.request("talk.session.cancelOutput", { sessionId, reason: "barge-in" });
await gateway.request("talk.session.submitToolResult", {
  sessionId,
  callId,
  result: { status: "working" },
  options: { willContinue: true },
});
await gateway.request("talk.session.submitToolResult", {
  sessionId,
  callId,
  result: { status: "already_delivered" },
  options: { suppressResponse: true },
});
await gateway.request("talk.session.submitToolResult", { sessionId, callId, result });
await gateway.request("talk.session.close", { sessionId });

// Client-owned provider session API.
await gateway.request("talk.client.create", {
  mode: "realtime",
  transport: "webrtc",
  brain: "agent-consult",
  sessionKey: "main",
});
await gateway.request("talk.client.toolCall", { sessionKey, callId, name, args });
await gateway.request("talk.client.steer", { sessionKey, text, mode: "steer" });
```

Browser-owned WebRTC/provider-websocket sessions use `talk.client.create`,
because the browser owns the provider negotiation and media transport while the
Gateway owns credentials, instructions, and tool policy. `talk.session.*` is the
common Gateway-managed surface for gateway-relay realtime, gateway-relay
transcription, and managed-room native STT/TTS sessions.

Legacy configs that placed realtime selectors beside `talk.provider` /
`talk.providers` should be repaired with `openclaw doctor --fix`; runtime Talk
does not reinterpret speech/TTS provider config as realtime provider config.

The supported `talk.session.create` combinations are intentionally small:

| Mode            | Transport       | Brain           | Owner              | Notes                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `realtime`      | `gateway-relay` | `agent-consult` | Gateway            | Full-duplex provider audio bridged through the Gateway; tool calls are routed through the agent-consult tool.      |
| `transcription` | `gateway-relay` | `none`          | Gateway            | Streaming STT only; callers send input audio and receive transcript events.                                        |
| `stt-tts`       | `managed-room`  | `agent-consult` | Native/client room | Push-to-talk and walkie-talkie style rooms where the client owns capture/playback and the Gateway owns turn state. |
| `stt-tts`       | `managed-room`  | `direct-tools`  | Native/client room | Admin-only room mode for trusted first-party surfaces that execute Gateway tool actions directly.                  |

Removed method map:

| Old                              | New                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |

| `talk.realtime.relayToolResult`  | `talk.session.submitToolResult`                          |
| `talk.realtime.relayStop`        | `talk.session.close`                                     |

| `talk.transcription.relayAudio`  | `talk.session.appendAudio`                               |
| `talk.transcription.relayCancel` | `talk.session.cancelTurn`                                |
| `talk.transcription.relayStop`   | `talk.session.close`                                     |
| `talk.handoff.create`            | `talk.session.create({ transport: "managed-room" })`     |
| `talk.handoff.join`              | `talk.session.join`                                      |
| `talk.handoff.revoke`            | `talk.session.close`                                     |

The unified control vocabulary is also deliberately narrow:

| Method                          | Applies to                                              | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Do not introduce provider or platform special cases in core to make this work.
Core owns Talk session semantics. Provider plugins own vendor session setup.
Voice-call and Google Meet own telephony/meeting adapters. Browser and native
apps own device capture/playback UX.

## Compatibility policy

For external plugins, compatibility work follows this order:

1. add the new contract
2. keep the old behavior wired through a compatibility adapter
3. emit a diagnostic or warning that names the old path and replacement
4. cover both paths in tests
5. document the deprecation and migration path
6. remove only after the announced migration window, usually in a major release

Maintainers can audit the current migration queue with
`pnpm plugins:boundary-report`. Use `pnpm plugins:boundary-report:summary` for
compact counts, `--owner <id>` for one plugin or compatibility owner, and
`pnpm plugins:boundary-report:ci` when a CI gate should fail on due
compatibility records, cross-owner reserved SDK imports, or unused reserved SDK
subpaths. The report groups deprecated
compatibility records by removal date, counts local code/docs references,
surfaces cross-owner reserved SDK imports, and summarizes the private
memory-host SDK bridge so compatibility cleanup stays explicit instead of
relying on ad hoc searches. Reserved SDK subpaths must have tracked owner usage;
unused reserved helper exports should be removed from the public SDK.

If a manifest field is still accepted, plugin authors can keep using it until
the docs and diagnostics say otherwise. New code should prefer the documented
replacement, but existing plugins should not break during ordinary minor
releases.

## How to migrate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Migrate runtime config load/write helpers">
    Bundled plugins should stop calling
    `api.runtime.config.loadConfig()` and
    `api.runtime.config.writeConfigFile(...)` directly. Prefer config that was
    already passed into the active call path. Long-lived handlers that need the
    current process snapshot can use `api.runtime.config.current()`. Long-lived
    agent tools should use the tool context's `ctx.getRuntimeConfig()` inside
    `execute` so a tool created before a config write still sees the refreshed
    runtime config.

    Config writes must go through the transactional helpers and choose an
    after-write policy:

    ```typescript
    await api.runtime.config.mutateConfigFile({
      afterWrite: { mode: "auto" },
      mutate(draft) {
        draft.plugins ??= {};
      },
    });
    ```

    Use `afterWrite: { mode: "restart", reason: "..." }` when the caller knows
    the change requires a clean gateway restart, and
    `afterWrite: { mode: "none", reason: "..." }` only when the caller owns the
    follow-up and deliberately wants to suppress the reload planner.
    Mutation results include a typed `followUp` summary for tests and logging;
    the gateway remains responsible for applying or scheduling the restart.
    `loadConfig` and `writeConfigFile` remain as deprecated compatibility
    helpers for external plugins during the migration window and warn once with
    the `runtime-config-load-write` compatibility code. Bundled plugins and repo
    runtime code are protected by scanner guardrails in
    `pnpm check:deprecated-api-usage` and
    `pnpm check:no-runtime-action-load-config`: new production plugin usage
    fails outright, direct config writes fail, gateway server methods must use
    the request runtime snapshot, runtime channel send/action/client helpers
    must receive config from their boundary, and long-lived runtime modules have
    zero allowed ambient `loadConfig()` calls.

    New plugin code should also avoid importing the broad
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-runtime` compatibility barrel. Use the narrow
    SDK subpath that matches the job:

    | Need | Import |
    | --- | --- |
    | Config types such as `OpenClawConfig` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-contracts` |
    | Already-loaded config assertions and plugin-entry config lookup | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-config-runtime` |
    | Current runtime snapshot reads | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-config-snapshot` |
    | Config writes | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-mutation` |
    | Session store helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/session-store-runtime` |
    | Markdown table config | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/markdown-table-runtime` |
    | Group policy runtime helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-group-policy` |
    | Secret input resolution | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/secret-input-runtime` |
    | Model/session overrides | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/model-session-runtime` |

    Bundled plugins and their tests are scanner-guarded against the broad
    barrel so imports and mocks stay local to the behavior they need. The broad
    barrel still exists for external compatibility, but new code should not
    depend on it.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate embedded tool-result extensions to middleware">
    Bundled plugins must replace embedded-runner-only
    `api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory(...)` tool-result handlers with
    runtime-neutral middleware.

    ```typescript
    // OpenClaw and Codex runtime dynamic tools
    api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(async (event) => {
      return compactToolResult(event);
    }, {
      runtimes: ["openclaw", "codex"],
    });
    ```

    Update the plugin manifest at the same time:

    ```json
    {
      "contracts": {
        "agentToolResultMiddleware": ["openclaw", "codex"]
      }
    }
    ```

    External plugins cannot register tool-result middleware because it can
    rewrite high-trust tool output before the model sees it.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate approval-native handlers to capability facts">
    Approval-capable channel plugins now expose native approval behavior through
    `approvalCapability.nativeRuntime` plus the shared runtime-context registry.

    Key changes:

    - Replace `approvalCapability.handler.loadRuntime(...)` with
      `approvalCapability.nativeRuntime`
    - Move approval-specific auth/delivery off legacy `plugin.auth` /
      `plugin.approvals` wiring and onto `approvalCapability`
    - `ChannelPlugin.approvals` has been removed from the public channel-plugin
      contract; move delivery/native/render fields onto `approvalCapability`
    - `plugin.auth` remains for channel login/logout flows only; approval auth
      hooks there are no longer read by core
    - Register channel-owned runtime objects such as clients, tokens, or Bolt
      apps through `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-runtime-context`
    - Do not send plugin-owned reroute notices from native approval handlers;
      core now owns routed-elsewhere notices from actual delivery results
    - When passing `channelRuntime` into `createChannelManager(...)`, provide a
      real `createPluginRuntime().channel` surface. Partial stubs are rejected.

    See `/plugins/sdk-channel-plugins` for the current approval capability
    layout.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Windows wrapper fallback behavior">
    If your plugin uses `openclaw/plugin-sdk/windows-spawn`, unresolved Windows
    `.cmd`/`.bat` wrappers now fail closed unless you explicitly pass
    `allowShellFallback: true`.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    const program = applyWindowsSpawnProgramPolicy({ candidate });

    // After
    const program = applyWindowsSpawnProgramPolicy({
      candidate,
      // Only set this for trusted compatibility callers that intentionally
      // accept shell-mediated fallback.
      allowShellFallback: true,
    });
    ```

    If your caller does not intentionally rely on shell fallback, do not set
    `allowShellFallback` and handle the thrown error instead.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Find deprecated imports">
    Search your plugin for imports from either deprecated surface:

    ```bash
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/compat" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/infra-runtime" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/config-runtime" my-plugin/
    grep -r "openclaw/extension-api" my-plugin/
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace with focused imports">
    Each export from the old surface maps to a specific modern import path:

    ```typescript
    // Before (deprecated backwards-compatibility layer)
    import {
      createChannelReplyPipeline,
      createPluginRuntimeStore,
      resolveControlCommandGate,
    } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/compat";

    // After (modern focused imports)
    import { createChannelReplyPipeline } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-reply-pipeline";
    import { createPluginRuntimeStore } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-store";
    import { resolveControlCommandGate } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-auth";
    ```

    For host-side helpers, use the injected plugin runtime instead of importing
    directly:

    ```typescript
    // Before (deprecated extension-api bridge)
    import { runEmbeddedAgent } from "openclaw/extension-api";
    const result = await runEmbeddedAgent({ sessionId, prompt });

    // After (injected runtime)
    const result = await api.runtime.agent.runEmbeddedAgent({ sessionId, prompt });
    ```

    The same pattern applies to other legacy bridge helpers:

    | Old import | Modern equivalent |
    | --- | --- |
    | `resolveAgentDir` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentDir` |
    | `resolveAgentWorkspaceDir` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentWorkspaceDir` |
    | `resolveAgentIdentity` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentIdentity` |
    | `resolveThinkingDefault` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveThinkingDefault` |
    | `resolveAgentTimeoutMs` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentTimeoutMs` |
    | `ensureAgentWorkspace` | `api.runtime.agent.ensureAgentWorkspace` |
    | session store helpers | `api.runtime.agent.session.*` |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace broad infra-runtime imports">
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime` still exists for external
    compatibility, but new code should import the focused helper surface it
    actually needs:

    | Need | Import |
    | --- | --- |
    | System event queue helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/system-event-runtime` |
    | Heartbeat wake, event, and visibility helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/heartbeat-runtime` |
    | Pending delivery queue drain | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/delivery-queue-runtime` |
    | Channel activity telemetry | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-activity-runtime` |
    | In-memory dedupe caches | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/dedupe-runtime` |
    | Safe local-file/media path helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/file-access-runtime` |
    | Dispatcher-aware fetch | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-fetch` |
    | Proxy and guarded fetch helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/fetch-runtime` |
    | SSRF dispatcher policy types | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/ssrf-dispatcher` |
    | Approval request/resolution types | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/approval-runtime` |
    | Approval reply payload and command helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/approval-reply-runtime` |
    | Error formatting helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/error-runtime` |
    | Transport readiness waits | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/transport-ready-runtime` |
    | Secure token helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/secure-random-runtime` |
    | Bounded async task concurrency | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/concurrency-runtime` |
    | Numeric coercion | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/number-runtime` |
    | Process-local async lock | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/async-lock-runtime` |
    | File locks | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/file-lock` |

    Bundled plugins are scanner-guarded against `infra-runtime`, so repo code
    cannot regress to the broad barrel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate channel route helpers">
    New channel route code should use `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-route`.
    The older route-key and comparable-target names remain as compatibility
    aliases during the migration window, but new plugins should use the route
    names that describe the behavior directly:

    | Old helper | Modern helper |
    | --- | --- |
    | `channelRouteIdentityKey(...)` | `channelRouteDedupeKey(...)` |
    | `channelRouteKey(...)` | `channelRouteCompactKey(...)` |
    | `ComparableChannelTarget` | `ChannelRouteParsedTarget` |
    | `comparableChannelTargetsMatch(...)` | `channelRouteTargetsMatchExact(...)` |
    | `comparableChannelTargetsShareRoute(...)` | `channelRouteTargetsShareConversation(...)` |

    The modern route helpers normalize `{ channel, to, accountId, threadId }`
    consistently across native approvals, reply suppression, inbound dedupe,
    cron delivery, and session routing.

    Do not add new uses of `ChannelMessagingAdapter.parseExplicitTarget` or
    the parser-backed loaded-route helpers (`parseExplicitTargetForLoadedChannel`
    or `resolveRouteTargetForLoadedChannel`) or
    `resolveChannelRouteTargetWithParser(...)` from `plugin-sdk/channel-route`.
    Those hooks are deprecated and remain only for older plugins during the
    migration window. New channel plugins should use
    `messaging.targetResolver.resolveTarget(...)` for target id normalization
    and directory-miss fallback, `messaging.inferTargetChatType(...)` when core
    needs an early peer kind, and `messaging.resolveOutboundSessionRoute(...)`
    for provider-native session and thread identity.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build and test">
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    pnpm test -- my-plugin/
    ```
  </Step>

</Accordion>

This table is intentionally the common migration subset, not the full SDK
surface. The compiler entrypoint inventory lives in
`scripts/lib/plugin-sdk-entrypoints.json`; package exports are generated from
the public subset.

Reserved bundled-plugin helper seams have been retired from the public SDK
export map except for explicitly documented compatibility facades such as the
deprecated `plugin-sdk/discord` shim retained for the published
`@openclaw/discord@2026.3.13` package. Owner-specific helpers live inside the
owning plugin package; shared host behavior should move through generic SDK
contracts such as `plugin-sdk/gateway-runtime`, `plugin-sdk/security-runtime`,
and `plugin-sdk/plugin-config-runtime`.

Use the narrowest import that matches the job. If you cannot find an export,
check the source at `src/plugin-sdk/` or ask maintainers which generic contract
should own it.

## Active deprecations

Narrower deprecations that apply across the plugin SDK, provider contract,
runtime surface, and manifest. Each one still works today but will be removed
in a future major release. The entry below every item maps the old API to its
canonical replacement.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="command-auth help builders → command-status">
    **Old (`openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-auth`)**: `buildCommandsMessage`,
    `buildCommandsMessagePaginated`, `buildHelpMessage`.

    **New (`openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-status`)**: same signatures, same
    exports - just imported from the narrower subpath. `command-auth`
    re-exports them as compat stubs.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    import { buildHelpMessage } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-auth";

    // After
    import { buildHelpMessage } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/command-status";
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mention gating helpers → resolveInboundMentionDecision">
    **Old**: `resolveInboundMentionRequirement({ facts, policy })` and
    `shouldDropInboundForMention(...)` from
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-inbound` or
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-mention-gating`.

    **New**: `resolveInboundMentionDecision({ facts, policy })` - returns a
    single decision object instead of two split calls.

    Downstream channel plugins (Slack, Discord, Matrix, MS Teams) have already
    switched.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Channel runtime shim and channel actions helpers">
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-runtime` is a compatibility shim for older
    channel plugins. Do not import it from new code; use
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-runtime-context` for registering runtime
    objects.

    `channelActions*` helpers in `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-actions` are
    deprecated alongside raw "actions" channel exports. Expose capabilities
    through the semantic `presentation` surface instead - channel plugins
    declare what they render (cards, buttons, selects) rather than which raw
    action names they accept.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Web search provider tool() helper → createTool() on the plugin">
    **Old**: `tool()` factory from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/provider-web-search`.

    **New**: implement `createTool(...)` directly on the provider plugin.
    OpenClaw no longer needs the SDK helper to register the tool wrapper.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plaintext channel envelopes → BodyForAgent">
    **Old**: `formatInboundEnvelope(...)` (and
    `ChannelMessageForAgent.channelEnvelope`) to build a flat plaintext prompt
    envelope from inbound channel messages.

    **New**: `BodyForAgent` plus structured user-context blocks. Channel
    plugins attach routing metadata (thread, topic, reply-to, reactions) as
    typed fields instead of concatenating them into a prompt string. The
    `formatAgentEnvelope(...)` helper is still supported for synthesized
    assistant-facing envelopes, but inbound plaintext envelopes are on the
    way out.

    Affected areas: `inbound_claim`, `message_received`, and any custom
    channel plugin that post-processed `channelEnvelope` text.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="deactivate hook → gateway_stop">
    **Old**: `api.on("deactivate", handler)`.

    **New**: `api.on("gateway_stop", handler)`. The event and context are the
    same shutdown cleanup contract; only the hook name changes.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    api.on("deactivate", async (event, ctx) => {
      await stopPluginService(ctx);
    });

    // After
    api.on("gateway_stop", async (event, ctx) => {
      await stopPluginService(ctx);
    });
    ```

    `deactivate` remains wired as a deprecated compatibility alias until after
    2026-08-16.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="subagent_spawning hook → core thread binding">
    **Old**: `api.on("subagent_spawning", handler)` returning
    `threadBindingReady` or `deliveryOrigin`.

    **New**: let core prepare `thread: true` subagent bindings through the
    channel session-binding adapter. Use `api.on("subagent_spawned", handler)`
    only for post-launch observation.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    api.on("subagent_spawning", async () => ({
      status: "ok",
      threadBindingReady: true,
      deliveryOrigin: { channel: "discord", to: "channel:123", threadId: "456" },
    }));

    // After
    api.on("subagent_spawned", async (event) => {
      await observeSubagentLaunch(event);
    });
    ```

    `subagent_spawning`, `PluginHookSubagentSpawningEvent`,
    `PluginHookSubagentSpawningResult`, and
    `SubagentLifecycleHookRunner.runSubagentSpawning(...)` remain only as
    deprecated compatibility surfaces while external plugins migrate.

    Four discovery type aliases are now thin wrappers over the
    catalog-era types:

    | Old alias                 | New type                  |
    | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
    | `ProviderDiscoveryOrder`  | `ProviderCatalogOrder`    |
    | `ProviderDiscoveryContext`| `ProviderCatalogContext`  |
    | `ProviderDiscoveryResult` | `ProviderCatalogResult`   |
    | `ProviderPluginDiscovery` | `ProviderPluginCatalog`   |

    Plus the legacy `ProviderCapabilities` static bag - provider plugins
    should use explicit provider hooks such as `buildReplayPolicy`,
    `normalizeToolSchemas`, and `wrapStreamFn` rather than a static object.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thinking policy hooks → resolveThinkingProfile">
    **Old** (three separate hooks on `ProviderThinkingPolicy`):
    `isBinaryThinking(ctx)`, `supportsXHighThinking(ctx)`, and
    `resolveDefaultThinkingLevel(ctx)`.

    **New**: a single `resolveThinkingProfile(ctx)` that returns a
    `ProviderThinkingProfile` with the canonical `id`, optional `label`, and
    ranked level list. OpenClaw downgrades stale stored values by profile
    rank automatically.

    The context includes `provider`, `modelId`, optional merged `reasoning`,
    and optional merged model `compat` facts. Provider plugins can use those
    catalog facts to expose a model-specific profile only when the configured
    request contract supports it.

    Implement one hook instead of three. The legacy hooks keep working during
    the deprecation window but are not composed with the profile result.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="External auth providers → contracts.externalAuthProviders">
    **Old**: implementing external auth hooks without declaring the provider
    in the plugin manifest.

    **New**: declare `contracts.externalAuthProviders` in the plugin manifest
    **and** implement `resolveExternalAuthProfiles(...)`.

    ```json
    {
      "contracts": {
        "externalAuthProviders": ["anthropic", "openai"]
      }
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider env-var lookup → setup.providers[].envVars">
    **Old** manifest field: `providerAuthEnvVars: { anthropic: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] }`.

    **New**: mirror the same env-var lookup into `setup.providers[].envVars`
    on the manifest. This consolidates setup/status env metadata in one
    place and avoids booting the plugin runtime just to answer env-var
    lookups.

    `providerAuthEnvVars` remains supported through a compatibility adapter
    until the deprecation window closes.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory plugin registration → registerMemoryCapability">
    **Old**: three separate calls -
    `api.registerMemoryPromptSection(...)`,
    `api.registerMemoryFlushPlan(...)`,
    `api.registerMemoryRuntime(...)`.

    **New**: one call on the memory-state API -
    `registerMemoryCapability(pluginId, { promptBuilder, flushPlanResolver, runtime })`.

    Same slots, single registration call. Additive prompt and corpus helpers
    (`registerMemoryPromptSupplement`, `registerMemoryCorpusSupplement`) are
    not affected.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory embedding provider API">
    **Old**: `api.registerMemoryEmbeddingProvider(...)` plus
    `contracts.memoryEmbeddingProviders`.

    **New**: `api.registerEmbeddingProvider(...)` plus
    `contracts.embeddingProviders`.

    The generic embedding provider contract is reusable outside memory and is
    the supported path for new providers. The memory-specific registration API
    remains wired as deprecated compatibility while existing providers migrate.
    Plugin inspection reports non-bundled usage as compatibility debt.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subagent session messages types renamed">
    Two legacy type aliases still exported from `src/plugins/runtime/types.ts`:

    | Old                           | New                             |
    | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
    | `SubagentReadSessionParams`   | `SubagentGetSessionMessagesParams` |
    | `SubagentReadSessionResult`   | `SubagentGetSessionMessagesResult` |

    The runtime method `readSession` is deprecated in favor of
    `getSessionMessages`. Same signature; the old method calls through to the
    new one.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="runtime.tasks.flow → runtime.tasks.managedFlows">
    **Old**: `runtime.tasks.flow` (singular) returned a live task-flow accessor.

    **New**: `runtime.tasks.managedFlows` keeps the managed TaskFlow mutation
    runtime for plugins that create, update, cancel, or run child tasks from a
    flow. Use `runtime.tasks.flows` when the plugin only needs DTO-based reads.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    const flow = api.runtime.tasks.flow.fromToolContext(ctx);
    // After
    const flow = api.runtime.tasks.managedFlows.fromToolContext(ctx);
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Embedded extension factories → agent tool-result middleware">
    Covered in "How to migrate → Migrate embedded tool-result extensions to
    middleware" above. Included here for completeness: the removed embedded-runner-only
    `api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory(...)` path is replaced by
    `api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(...)` with an explicit runtime
    list in `contracts.agentToolResultMiddleware`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenClawSchemaType alias → OpenClawConfig">
    `OpenClawSchemaType` re-exported from `openclaw/plugin-sdk` is now a
    one-line alias for `OpenClawConfig`. Prefer the canonical name.

    ```typescript
    // Before
    import type { OpenClawSchemaType } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk";
    // After
    import type { OpenClawConfig } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-schema";
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Extension-level deprecations (inside bundled channel/provider plugins under
`extensions/`) are tracked inside their own `api.ts` and `runtime-api.ts`
barrels. They do not affect third-party plugin contracts and are not listed
here. If you consume a bundled plugin's local barrel directly, read the
deprecation comments in that barrel before upgrading.
</Note>

## Removal timeline

| When                   | What happens                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Now**                | Deprecated surfaces emit runtime warnings                               |
| **Next major release** | Deprecated surfaces will be removed; plugins still using them will fail |

All core plugins have already been migrated. External plugins should migrate
before the next major release.

## Suppressing the warnings temporarily

Set these environment variables while you work on migrating:

```bash
OPENCLAW_SUPPRESS_PLUGIN_SDK_COMPAT_WARNING=1 openclaw gateway run
OPENCLAW_SUPPRESS_EXTENSION_API_WARNING=1 openclaw gateway run
```

This is a temporary escape hatch, not a permanent solution.

// Unit tests for createSlackSetupWizardProxy. The Slack channel plugin
// installs this proxy as setupWizard so the heavy ./setup-surface module is
// only imported when wizard methods that actually need it are invoked.
//
// These tests use a fake loader so the proxy can be tested type-safely
// against the wider ChannelSetupWizard contract, without going through the
// (narrower) ChannelPluginSetupWizard surface exposed on slackPlugin.

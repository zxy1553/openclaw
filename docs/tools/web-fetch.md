The `web_fetch` tool does a plain HTTP GET and extracts readable content
(HTML to markdown or text). It does **not** execute JavaScript.

For JS-heavy sites or login-protected pages, use the
[Web Browser](/tools/browser) instead.

## Quick start

`web_fetch` is **enabled by default** -- no configuration needed. The agent can
call it immediately:

```javascript
await web_fetch({ url: "https://example.com/article" });
```

## Tool parameters

<ParamField path="url" type="string" required>
URL to fetch. `http(s)` only.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="extractMode" type="'markdown' | 'text'" default="markdown">
Output format after main-content extraction.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="maxChars" type="number">
Truncate output to this many characters.
</ParamField>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch">
    Sends an HTTP GET with a Chrome-like User-Agent and `Accept-Language`
    header. Blocks private/internal hostnames and re-checks redirects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract">
    Runs Readability (main-content extraction) on the HTML response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fallback (optional)">
    If Readability fails and Firecrawl is configured, retries through the
    Firecrawl API with bot-circumvention mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cache">
    Results are cached for 15 minutes (configurable) to reduce repeated
    fetches of the same URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Progress updates

`web_fetch` emits a public progress line only when the fetch is still pending
after five seconds:

```text
Fetching page content...
```

Fast cache hits and quick network responses finish before the timer fires, so
they do not show a progress line. If the call is canceled, the timer is cleared.
When the fetch eventually completes, the agent receives the normal tool result;
the progress line is only channel UI state and never contains fetched page
content.

## Config

```json5
{
  tools: {
    web: {
      fetch: {
        enabled: true, // default: true
        provider: "firecrawl", // optional; omit for auto-detect
        maxChars: 50000, // max output chars
        maxCharsCap: 50000, // hard cap for maxChars param
        maxResponseBytes: 2000000, // max download size before truncation
        timeoutSeconds: 30,
        cacheTtlMinutes: 15,
        maxRedirects: 3,
        useTrustedEnvProxy: false, // let a trusted HTTP(S) env proxy resolve DNS
        readability: true, // use Readability extraction
        userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 ...", // override User-Agent
        ssrfPolicy: {
          allowRfc2544BenchmarkRange: true, // opt-in for trusted fake-IP proxies using 198.18.0.0/15
          allowIpv6UniqueLocalRange: true, // opt-in for trusted fake-IP proxies using fc00::/7
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Firecrawl fallback

If Readability extraction fails, `web_fetch` can fall back to
[Firecrawl](/tools/firecrawl) for bot-circumvention and better extraction:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    web: {
      fetch: {
        provider: "firecrawl", // optional; omit for auto-detect from available credentials
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      firecrawl: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          webFetch: {
            apiKey: "fc-...", // optional if FIRECRAWL_API_KEY is set
            baseUrl: "https://api.firecrawl.dev",
            onlyMainContent: true,
            maxAgeMs: 86400000, // cache duration (1 day)
            timeoutSeconds: 60,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`plugins.entries.firecrawl.config.webFetch.apiKey` supports SecretRef objects.
Legacy `tools.web.fetch.firecrawl.*` config is auto-migrated by `openclaw doctor --fix`.

<Note>
  If Firecrawl is enabled and its SecretRef is unresolved with no
  `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` env fallback, gateway startup fails fast.
</Note>

<Note>
  Firecrawl `baseUrl` overrides are locked down: hosted traffic uses
  `https://api.firecrawl.dev`; self-hosted overrides must target private or
  internal endpoints, and `http://` is accepted only for those private targets.
</Note>

Current runtime behavior:

- `tools.web.fetch.provider` selects the fetch fallback provider explicitly.
- If `provider` is omitted, OpenClaw auto-detects the first ready web-fetch
  provider from available credentials. Non-sandboxed `web_fetch` can use
  installed plugins that declare `contracts.webFetchProviders` and register a
  matching provider at runtime. Today the bundled provider is Firecrawl.
- Sandboxed `web_fetch` calls stay limited to bundled providers.
- If Readability is disabled, `web_fetch` skips straight to the selected
  provider fallback. If no provider is available, it fails closed.

## Trusted env proxy

If your deployment requires `web_fetch` to go through a trusted outbound
HTTP(S) proxy, set `tools.web.fetch.useTrustedEnvProxy: true`.

In this mode, OpenClaw still applies hostname-based SSRF checks before sending
the request, but it lets the proxy resolve DNS instead of doing local DNS
pinning. Enable this only when the proxy is operator-controlled and enforces
outbound policy after DNS resolution.

<Note>
  If no HTTP(S) proxy env var is configured, or the target host is excluded by
  `NO_PROXY`, `web_fetch` falls back to the normal strict path with local DNS
  pinning.
</Note>

## Limits and safety

- `maxChars` is clamped to `tools.web.fetch.maxCharsCap`
- Response body is capped at `maxResponseBytes` before parsing; oversized
  responses are truncated with a warning
- Private/internal hostnames are blocked
- `tools.web.fetch.ssrfPolicy.allowRfc2544BenchmarkRange` and
  `tools.web.fetch.ssrfPolicy.allowIpv6UniqueLocalRange` are narrow opt-ins
  for trusted fake-IP proxy stacks; leave them unset unless your proxy owns
  those synthetic ranges and enforces its own destination policy
- Redirects are checked and limited by `maxRedirects`
- `useTrustedEnvProxy` is an explicit opt-in and should only be enabled for
  operator-controlled proxies that still enforce outbound policy after DNS
  resolution
- `web_fetch` is best-effort -- some sites need the [Web Browser](/tools/browser)

## Tool profiles

If you use tool profiles or allowlists, add `web_fetch` or `group:web`:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    allow: ["web_fetch"],
    // or: allow: ["group:web"]  (includes web_fetch, web_search, and x_search)
  },
}
```

  - Working on Microsoft Teams channel features
title: "Microsoft Teams"
---

Status: text + DM attachments are supported; channel/group file sending requires `sharePointSiteId` + Graph permissions (see [Sending files in group chats](#sending-files-in-group-chats)). Polls are sent via Adaptive Cards. Message actions expose explicit `upload-file` for file-first sends.

## Bundled plugin

Microsoft Teams ships as a bundled plugin in current OpenClaw releases, so no
separate install is required in the normal packaged build.

If you are on an older build or a custom install that excludes bundled Teams,
install the npm package directly:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/msteams
```

Use the bare package to follow the current official release tag. Pin an exact
version only when you need a reproducible install.

Local checkout (when running from a git repo):

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./path/to/local/msteams-plugin
```

Details: [Plugins](/tools/plugin)

## Quick setup

The [`@microsoft/teams.cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams.cli) handles bot registration, manifest creation, and credential generation in a single command.

**1. Install and log in**

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/teams.cli@preview
teams login
teams status   # verify you're logged in and see your tenant info
```

<Note>
The Teams CLI is currently in preview. Commands and flags may change between releases.
</Note>

**2. Start a tunnel** (Teams can't reach localhost)

Install and authenticate the devtunnel CLI if you haven't already ([getting started guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started)).

```bash
# One-time setup (persistent URL across sessions):
devtunnel create my-openclaw-bot --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create my-openclaw-bot -p 3978 --protocol auto

# Each dev session:
devtunnel host my-openclaw-bot
# Your endpoint: https://<tunnel-id>.devtunnels.ms/api/messages
```

<Note>
`--allow-anonymous` is required because Teams cannot authenticate with devtunnels. Each incoming bot request is still validated by the Teams SDK automatically.
</Note>

Alternatives: `ngrok http 3978` or `tailscale funnel 3978` (but these may change URLs each session).

**3. Create the app**

```bash
teams app create \
  --name "OpenClaw" \
  --endpoint "https://<your-tunnel-url>/api/messages"
```

This single command:

- Creates an Entra ID (Azure AD) application
- Generates a client secret
- Builds and uploads a Teams app manifest (with icons)
- Registers the bot (Teams-managed by default - no Azure subscription needed)

The output will show `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `TENANT_ID`, and a **Teams App ID** - note these for the next steps. It also offers to install the app in Teams directly.

**4. Configure OpenClaw** using the credentials from the output:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
      appPassword: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
      tenantId: "<TENANT_ID>",
      webhook: { port: 3978, path: "/api/messages" },
    },
  },
}
```

Or use environment variables directly: `MSTEAMS_APP_ID`, `MSTEAMS_APP_PASSWORD`, `MSTEAMS_TENANT_ID`.

**5. Install the app in Teams**

`teams app create` will prompt you to install the app - select "Install in Teams". If you skipped it, you can get the link later:

```bash
teams app get <teamsAppId> --install-link
```

**6. Verify everything works**

```bash
teams app doctor <teamsAppId>
```

This runs diagnostics across bot registration, AAD app config, manifest validity, and SSO setup.

For production deployments, consider using [federated authentication](/channels/msteams#federated-authentication-certificate-plus-managed-identity) (certificate or managed identity) instead of client secrets.

<Note>
Group chats are blocked by default (`channels.msteams.groupPolicy: "allowlist"`). To allow group replies, set `channels.msteams.groupAllowFrom`, or use `groupPolicy: "open"` to allow any member (mention-gated).
</Note>

## Goals

- Talk to OpenClaw via Teams DMs, group chats, or channels.
- Keep routing deterministic: replies always go back to the channel they arrived on.
- Default to safe channel behavior (mentions required unless configured otherwise).

## Config writes

By default, Microsoft Teams is allowed to write config updates triggered by `/config set|unset` (requires `commands.config: true`).

Disable with:

```json5
{
  channels: { msteams: { configWrites: false } },
}
```

## Access control (DMs + groups)

**DM access**

- Default: `channels.msteams.dmPolicy = "pairing"`. Unknown senders are ignored until approved.
- `channels.msteams.allowFrom` should use stable AAD object IDs or static sender access groups such as `accessGroup:core-team`.
- Do not rely on UPN/display-name matching for allowlists - they can change. OpenClaw disables direct name matching by default; opt in explicitly with `channels.msteams.dangerouslyAllowNameMatching: true`.
- The wizard can resolve names to IDs via Microsoft Graph when credentials allow.

**Group access**

- Default: `channels.msteams.groupPolicy = "allowlist"` (blocked unless you add `groupAllowFrom`). Use `channels.defaults.groupPolicy` to override the default when unset.
- `channels.msteams.groupAllowFrom` controls which senders or static sender access groups can trigger in group chats/channels (falls back to `channels.msteams.allowFrom`).
- Set `groupPolicy: "open"` to allow any member (still mention-gated by default).
- To allow **no channels**, set `channels.msteams.groupPolicy: "disabled"`.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowFrom: ["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", "accessGroup:core-team"],
    },
  },
}
```

**Teams + channel allowlist**

- Scope group/channel replies by listing teams and channels under `channels.msteams.teams`.
- Keys should use stable Teams conversation IDs from Teams links, not mutable display names.
- When `groupPolicy="allowlist"` and a teams allowlist is present, only listed teams/channels are accepted (mention-gated).
- The configure wizard accepts `Team/Channel` entries and stores them for you.
- On startup, OpenClaw resolves team/channel and user allowlist names to IDs (when Graph permissions allow)
  and logs the mapping; unresolved team/channel names are kept as typed but ignored for routing by default unless `channels.msteams.dangerouslyAllowNameMatching: true` is enabled.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      teams: {
        "My Team": {
          channels: {
            General: { requireMention: true },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

<summary><strong>Manual setup (without the Teams CLI)</strong></summary>

If you can't use the Teams CLI, you can set up the bot manually through the Azure Portal.

### How it works

1. Ensure the Microsoft Teams plugin is available (bundled in current releases).
2. Create an **Azure Bot** (App ID + secret + tenant ID).
3. Build a **Teams app package** that references the bot and includes the RSC permissions below.
4. Upload/install the Teams app into a team (or personal scope for DMs).
5. Configure `msteams` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (or env vars) and start the gateway.
6. The gateway listens for Bot Framework webhook traffic on `/api/messages` by default.

### Step 1: Create Azure Bot

1. Go to [Create Azure Bot](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureBot)
2. Fill in the **Basics** tab:

   | Field              | Value                                                    |
   | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Bot handle**     | Your bot name, e.g., `openclaw-msteams` (must be unique) |
   | **Subscription**   | Select your Azure subscription                           |
   | **Resource group** | Create new or use existing                               |
   | **Pricing tier**   | **Free** for dev/testing                                 |
   | **Type of App**    | **Single Tenant** (recommended - see note below)         |
   | **Creation type**  | **Create new Microsoft App ID**                          |

<Warning>
Creation of new multi-tenant bots was deprecated after 2025-07-31. Use **Single Tenant** for new bots.
</Warning>

3. Click **Review + create** → **Create** (wait ~1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Get Credentials

1. Go to your Azure Bot resource → **Configuration**
2. Copy **Microsoft App ID** → this is your `appId`
3. Click **Manage Password** → go to the App Registration
4. Under **Certificates & secrets** → **New client secret** → copy the **Value** → this is your `appPassword`
5. Go to **Overview** → copy **Directory (tenant) ID** → this is your `tenantId`

### Step 3: Configure Messaging Endpoint

1. In Azure Bot → **Configuration**
2. Set **Messaging endpoint** to your webhook URL:
   - Production: `https://your-domain.com/api/messages`
   - Local dev: Use a tunnel (see [Local Development](#local-development-tunneling) below)

### Step 4: Enable Teams Channel

1. In Azure Bot → **Channels**
2. Click **Microsoft Teams** → Configure → Save
3. Accept the Terms of Service

### Step 5: Build Teams App Manifest

- Include a `bot` entry with `botId = <App ID>`.
- Scopes: `personal`, `team`, `groupChat`.
- `supportsFiles: true` (required for personal scope file handling).
- Add RSC permissions (see [RSC Permissions](#current-teams-rsc-permissions-manifest)).
- Create icons: `outline.png` (32x32) and `color.png` (192x192).
- Zip all three files together: `manifest.json`, `outline.png`, `color.png`.

### Step 6: Configure OpenClaw

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "<APP_ID>",
      appPassword: "<APP_PASSWORD>",
      tenantId: "<TENANT_ID>",
      webhook: { port: 3978, path: "/api/messages" },
    },
  },
}
```

Environment variables: `MSTEAMS_APP_ID`, `MSTEAMS_APP_PASSWORD`, `MSTEAMS_TENANT_ID`.

### Step 7: Run the Gateway

The Teams channel starts automatically when the plugin is available and `msteams` config exists with credentials.

## Federated authentication (certificate plus managed identity)

> Added in 2026.4.11

For production deployments, OpenClaw supports **federated authentication** as a more secure alternative to client secrets. Two methods are available:

### Option A: Certificate-based authentication

Use a PEM certificate registered with your Entra ID app registration.

**Setup:**

1. Generate or obtain a certificate (PEM format with private key).
2. In Entra ID → App Registration → **Certificates & secrets** → **Certificates** → Upload the public certificate.

**Config:**

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "<APP_ID>",
      tenantId: "<TENANT_ID>",
      authType: "federated",
      certificatePath: "/path/to/cert.pem",
      webhook: { port: 3978, path: "/api/messages" },
    },
  },
}
```

**Env vars:**

- `MSTEAMS_AUTH_TYPE=federated`
- `MSTEAMS_CERTIFICATE_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem`

### Option B: Azure Managed Identity

Use Azure Managed Identity for passwordless authentication. This is ideal for deployments on Azure infrastructure (AKS, App Service, Azure VMs) where a managed identity is available.

**How it works:**

1. The bot pod/VM has a managed identity (system-assigned or user-assigned).
2. A **federated identity credential** links the managed identity to the Entra ID app registration.
3. At runtime, OpenClaw uses `@azure/identity` to acquire tokens from the Azure IMDS endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).
4. The token is passed to the Teams SDK for bot authentication.

**Prerequisites:**

- Azure infrastructure with managed identity enabled (AKS workload identity, App Service, VM)
- Federated identity credential created on the Entra ID app registration
- Network access to IMDS (`169.254.169.254:80`) from the pod/VM

**Config (system-assigned managed identity):**

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "<APP_ID>",
      tenantId: "<TENANT_ID>",
      authType: "federated",
      useManagedIdentity: true,
      webhook: { port: 3978, path: "/api/messages" },
    },
  },
}
```

**Config (user-assigned managed identity):**

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "<APP_ID>",
      tenantId: "<TENANT_ID>",
      authType: "federated",
      useManagedIdentity: true,
      managedIdentityClientId: "<MI_CLIENT_ID>",
      webhook: { port: 3978, path: "/api/messages" },
    },
  },
}
```

**Env vars:**

- `MSTEAMS_AUTH_TYPE=federated`
- `MSTEAMS_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=true`
- `MSTEAMS_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>` (only for user-assigned)

### AKS Workload Identity Setup

For AKS deployments using workload identity:

1. **Enable workload identity** on your AKS cluster.
2. **Create a federated identity credential** on the Entra ID app registration:

   ```bash
   az ad app federated-credential create --id <APP_OBJECT_ID> --parameters '{
     "name": "my-bot-workload-identity",
     "issuer": "<AKS_OIDC_ISSUER_URL>",
     "subject": "system:serviceaccount:<NAMESPACE>:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT>",
     "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
   }'
   ```

3. **Annotate the Kubernetes service account** with the app client ID:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: my-bot-sa
     annotations:
       azure.workload.identity/client-id: "<APP_CLIENT_ID>"
   ```

4. **Label the pod** for workload identity injection:

   ```yaml
   metadata:
     labels:
       azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
   ```

5. **Ensure network access** to IMDS (`169.254.169.254`) - if using NetworkPolicy, add an egress rule allowing traffic to `169.254.169.254/32` on port 80.

### Auth type comparison

| Method               | Config                                         | Pros                               | Cons                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Client secret**    | `appPassword`                                  | Simple setup                       | Secret rotation required, less secure |
| **Certificate**      | `authType: "federated"` + `certificatePath`    | No shared secret over network      | Certificate management overhead       |
| **Managed Identity** | `authType: "federated"` + `useManagedIdentity` | Passwordless, no secrets to manage | Azure infrastructure required         |

**Default behavior:** When `authType` is not set, OpenClaw defaults to client secret authentication. Existing configurations continue to work without changes.

## Local development (tunneling)

Teams can't reach `localhost`. Use a persistent dev tunnel so your URL stays the same across sessions:

```bash
# One-time setup:
devtunnel create my-openclaw-bot --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create my-openclaw-bot -p 3978 --protocol auto

# Each dev session:
devtunnel host my-openclaw-bot
```

Alternatives: `ngrok http 3978` or `tailscale funnel 3978` (URLs may change each session).

If your tunnel URL changes, update the endpoint:

```bash
teams app update <teamsAppId> --endpoint "https://<new-url>/api/messages"
```

## Testing the Bot

**Run diagnostics:**

```bash
teams app doctor <teamsAppId>
```

Checks bot registration, AAD app, manifest, and SSO configuration in one pass.

**Send a test message:**

1. Install the Teams app (use the install link from `teams app get <id> --install-link`)
2. Find the bot in Teams and send a DM
3. Check gateway logs for incoming activity

## Environment variables

All config keys can be set via environment variables instead:

- `MSTEAMS_APP_ID`
- `MSTEAMS_APP_PASSWORD`
- `MSTEAMS_TENANT_ID`
- `MSTEAMS_AUTH_TYPE` (optional: `"secret"` or `"federated"`)
- `MSTEAMS_CERTIFICATE_PATH` (federated + certificate)
- `MSTEAMS_CERTIFICATE_THUMBPRINT` (optional, not required for auth)
- `MSTEAMS_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY` (federated + managed identity)
- `MSTEAMS_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` (user-assigned MI only)

## Member info action

OpenClaw exposes a Graph-backed `member-info` action for Microsoft Teams so agents and automations can resolve channel member details (display name, email, role) directly from Microsoft Graph.

Requirements:

- `Member.Read.Group` RSC permission (already in the recommended manifest)
- For cross-team lookups: `User.Read.All` Graph Application permission with admin consent

The action is gated by `channels.msteams.actions.memberInfo` (default: enabled when Graph credentials are available).

## History context

- `channels.msteams.historyLimit` controls how many recent channel/group messages are wrapped into the prompt.
- Falls back to `messages.groupChat.historyLimit`. Set `0` to disable (default 50).
- Fetched thread history is filtered by sender allowlists (`allowFrom` / `groupAllowFrom`), so thread context seeding only includes messages from allowed senders.
- Quoted attachment context (`ReplyTo*` derived from Teams reply HTML) is currently passed as received.
- In other words, allowlists gate who can trigger the agent; only specific supplemental context paths are filtered today.
- DM history can be limited with `channels.msteams.dmHistoryLimit` (user turns). Per-user overrides: `channels.msteams.dms["<user_id>"].historyLimit`.

## Current Teams RSC permissions (manifest)

These are the **existing resourceSpecific permissions** in our Teams app manifest. They only apply inside the team/chat where the app is installed.

**For channels (team scope):**

- `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` (Application) - receive all channel messages without @mention
- `ChannelMessage.Send.Group` (Application)
- `Member.Read.Group` (Application)
- `Owner.Read.Group` (Application)
- `ChannelSettings.Read.Group` (Application)
- `TeamMember.Read.Group` (Application)
- `TeamSettings.Read.Group` (Application)

**For group chats:**

- `ChatMessage.Read.Chat` (Application) - receive all group chat messages without @mention

To add RSC permissions via the Teams CLI:

```bash
teams app rsc add <teamsAppId> ChannelMessage.Read.Group --type Application
```

## Example Teams manifest (redacted)

Minimal, valid example with the required fields. Replace IDs and URLs.

```json5
{
  $schema: "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.23/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  manifestVersion: "1.23",
  version: "1.0.0",
  id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  name: { short: "OpenClaw" },
  developer: {
    name: "Your Org",
    websiteUrl: "https://example.com",
    privacyUrl: "https://example.com/privacy",
    termsOfUseUrl: "https://example.com/terms",
  },
  description: { short: "OpenClaw in Teams", full: "OpenClaw in Teams" },
  icons: { outline: "outline.png", color: "color.png" },
  accentColor: "#5B6DEF",
  bots: [
    {
      botId: "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
      scopes: ["personal", "team", "groupChat"],
      isNotificationOnly: false,
      supportsCalling: false,
      supportsVideo: false,
      supportsFiles: true,
    },
  ],
  webApplicationInfo: {
    id: "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  },
  authorization: {
    permissions: {
      resourceSpecific: [
        { name: "ChannelMessage.Read.Group", type: "Application" },
        { name: "ChannelMessage.Send.Group", type: "Application" },
        { name: "Member.Read.Group", type: "Application" },
        { name: "Owner.Read.Group", type: "Application" },
        { name: "ChannelSettings.Read.Group", type: "Application" },
        { name: "TeamMember.Read.Group", type: "Application" },
        { name: "TeamSettings.Read.Group", type: "Application" },
        { name: "ChatMessage.Read.Chat", type: "Application" },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

### Manifest caveats (must-have fields)

- `bots[].botId` **must** match the Azure Bot App ID.
- `webApplicationInfo.id` **must** match the Azure Bot App ID.
- `bots[].scopes` must include the surfaces you plan to use (`personal`, `team`, `groupChat`).
- `bots[].supportsFiles: true` is required for file handling in personal scope.
- `authorization.permissions.resourceSpecific` must include channel read/send if you want channel traffic.

### Updating an existing app

To update an already-installed Teams app (e.g., to add RSC permissions):

```bash
# Download, edit, and re-upload the manifest
teams app manifest download <teamsAppId> manifest.json
# Edit manifest.json locally...
teams app manifest upload manifest.json <teamsAppId>
# Version is auto-bumped if content changed
```

After updating, reinstall the app in each team for new permissions to take effect, and **fully quit and relaunch Teams** (not just close the window) to clear cached app metadata.

<details>
<summary>Manual manifest update (without CLI)</summary>

1. Update your `manifest.json` with the new settings
2. **Increment the `version` field** (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`)
3. **Re-zip** the manifest with icons (`manifest.json`, `outline.png`, `color.png`)
4. Upload the new zip:
   - **Teams Admin Center:** Teams apps → Manage apps → find your app → Upload new version
   - **Sideload:** In Teams → Apps → Manage your apps → Upload a custom app

</details>

## Capabilities: RSC only vs Graph

### With **Teams RSC only** (app installed, no Graph API permissions)

Works:

- Read channel message **text** content.
- Send channel message **text** content.
- Receive **personal (DM)** file attachments.

Does NOT work:

- Channel/group **image or file contents** (payload only includes HTML stub).
- Downloading attachments stored in SharePoint/OneDrive.
- Reading message history (beyond the live webhook event).

### With **Teams RSC + Microsoft Graph Application permissions**

Adds:

- Downloading hosted contents (images pasted into messages).
- Downloading file attachments stored in SharePoint/OneDrive.
- Reading channel/chat message history via Graph.

### RSC vs Graph API

| Capability              | RSC Permissions      | Graph API                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Real-time messages**  | Yes (via webhook)    | No (polling only)                   |
| **Historical messages** | No                   | Yes (can query history)             |
| **Setup complexity**    | App manifest only    | Requires admin consent + token flow |
| **Works offline**       | No (must be running) | Yes (query anytime)                 |

**Bottom line:** RSC is for real-time listening; Graph API is for historical access. For catching up on missed messages while offline, you need Graph API with `ChannelMessage.Read.All` (requires admin consent).

## Graph-enabled media + history (required for channels)

If you need images/files in **channels** or want to fetch **message history**, you must enable Microsoft Graph permissions and grant admin consent.

1. In Entra ID (Azure AD) **App Registration**, add Microsoft Graph **Application permissions**:
   - `ChannelMessage.Read.All` (channel attachments + history)
   - `Chat.Read.All` or `ChatMessage.Read.All` (group chats)
2. **Grant admin consent** for the tenant.
3. Bump the Teams app **manifest version**, re-upload, and **reinstall the app in Teams**.
4. **Fully quit and relaunch Teams** to clear cached app metadata.

**Additional permission for user mentions:** User @mentions work out of the box for users in the conversation. However, if you want to dynamically search and mention users who are **not in the current conversation**, add `User.Read.All` (Application) permission and grant admin consent.

## Known limitations

### Webhook timeouts

Teams delivers messages via HTTP webhook. If processing takes too long (e.g., slow LLM responses), you may see:

- Gateway timeouts
- Teams retrying the message (causing duplicates)
- Dropped replies

OpenClaw handles this by returning quickly and sending replies proactively, but very slow responses may still cause issues.

### Teams cloud and service URL support

This SDK-backed Teams path is live-validated for Microsoft Teams public cloud.

Inbound replies use the incoming Teams SDK turn context. Out-of-context proactive operations - sends, edits, deletes, cards, polls, file-consent messages, and queued long-running replies - use the stored conversation reference `serviceUrl`. Public cloud defaults to the Teams SDK public cloud environment and allows stored references on the public Teams Connector host: `https://smba.trafficmanager.net/`.

Public cloud is the default. You do not need to set `channels.msteams.cloud` or `channels.msteams.serviceUrl` for normal public-cloud bots.

For non-public Teams clouds, set `cloud` and the matching proactive boundary when Microsoft publishes one:

- `channels.msteams.cloud` selects the Teams SDK cloud preset for authentication, JWT validation, token services, and Graph scope.
- `channels.msteams.serviceUrl` selects the Bot Connector endpoint boundary used to validate stored conversation references before proactive sends, edits, deletes, cards, polls, file-consent messages, and queued long-running replies. It is required for USGov and DoD SDK clouds. For China/21Vianet, OpenClaw uses the SDK `China` preset and accepts stored/configured service URLs only on Azure China Bot Framework channel hosts.

Microsoft publishes the global proactive Bot Connector endpoints in the [Create the conversation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/conversations/send-proactive-messages?tabs=dotnet#create-the-conversation) section of the Teams proactive messaging docs. Use the incoming activity's `serviceUrl` when available; if you need a global proactive endpoint, use Microsoft's table.

| Teams environment | OpenClaw config                                             | Proactive `serviceUrl`                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Public            | no cloud/serviceUrl config needed                           | `https://smba.trafficmanager.net/teams`            |
| GCC               | set `serviceUrl`; no separate Teams SDK cloud preset exists | `https://smba.infra.gcc.teams.microsoft.com/teams` |
| GCC High          | `cloud: "USGov"` + `serviceUrl`                             | `https://smba.infra.gov.teams.microsoft.us/teams`  |
| DoD               | `cloud: "USGovDoD"` + `serviceUrl`                          | `https://smba.infra.dod.teams.microsoft.us/teams`  |
| China/21Vianet    | `cloud: "China"`                                            | use the incoming activity's `serviceUrl`           |

Example for GCC, where Microsoft documents a separate proactive service URL but the Teams SDK does not expose a separate GCC cloud preset:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "msteams": {
      "serviceUrl": "https://smba.infra.gcc.teams.microsoft.com/teams"
    }
  }
}
```

Example for GCC High:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "msteams": {
      "cloud": "USGov",
      "serviceUrl": "https://smba.infra.gov.teams.microsoft.us/teams"
    }
  }
}
```

`channels.msteams.serviceUrl` is restricted to supported Microsoft Teams Bot Connector hosts. When a service URL is configured, OpenClaw checks that the stored conversation `serviceUrl` uses the same host before proactive sends, edits, deletes, cards, polls, or queued long-running replies run. With the default public-cloud config, OpenClaw fails closed if a stored conversation points outside the public Teams Connector host. Receive a fresh message from the conversation after changing cloud/service URL settings so the stored conversation reference is current.

China/21Vianet does not have a separate global proactive `smba` URL in Microsoft's Teams proactive endpoint table. Configure `cloud: "China"` so the Teams SDK uses Azure China auth, token, and JWT endpoints. Proactive sends then require a stored conversation reference from an incoming China Teams activity, or an explicitly configured service URL, on the Azure China Bot Framework channel boundary (`*.botframework.azure.cn`). Graph-backed Teams helpers are currently disabled for `cloud: "China"` until OpenClaw routes Graph requests through the Azure China Graph endpoint.

### Formatting

Teams markdown is more limited than Slack or Discord:

- Basic formatting works: **bold**, _italic_, `code`, links
- Complex markdown (tables, nested lists) may not render correctly
- Adaptive Cards are supported for polls and semantic presentation sends (see below)

## Configuration

Key settings (see `/gateway/configuration` for shared channel patterns):

- `channels.msteams.enabled`: enable/disable the channel.
- `channels.msteams.appId`, `channels.msteams.appPassword`, `channels.msteams.tenantId`: bot credentials.
- `channels.msteams.cloud`: Teams SDK cloud environment (`Public`, `USGov`, `USGovDoD`, or `China`; default `Public`). Set this with `serviceUrl` for USGov/DoD SDK clouds; China uses the SDK preset and stored Azure China Bot Framework conversation references, with Graph-backed helpers disabled until Azure China Graph routing is implemented.
- `channels.msteams.serviceUrl`: Bot Connector service URL boundary for SDK proactive operations. Public cloud uses the SDK default; set this for GCC (`https://smba.infra.gcc.teams.microsoft.com/teams`), GCC High, or DoD. China accepts Azure China Bot Framework channel hosts when the stored conversation reference comes from Teams operated by 21Vianet.
- `channels.msteams.webhook.port` (default `3978`)
- `channels.msteams.webhook.path` (default `/api/messages`)
- `channels.msteams.dmPolicy`: `pairing | allowlist | open | disabled` (default: pairing)
- `channels.msteams.allowFrom`: DM allowlist (AAD object IDs recommended). The wizard resolves names to IDs during setup when Graph access is available.
- `channels.msteams.dangerouslyAllowNameMatching`: break-glass toggle to re-enable mutable UPN/display-name matching and direct team/channel name routing.
- `channels.msteams.textChunkLimit`: outbound text chunk size.
- `channels.msteams.chunkMode`: `length` (default) or `newline` to split on blank lines (paragraph boundaries) before length chunking.
- `channels.msteams.mediaAllowHosts`: allowlist for inbound attachment hosts (defaults to Microsoft/Teams domains).
- `channels.msteams.mediaAuthAllowHosts`: allowlist for attaching Authorization headers on media retries (defaults to Graph + Bot Framework hosts).
- `channels.msteams.requireMention`: require @mention in channels/groups (default true).
- `channels.msteams.replyStyle`: `thread | top-level` (see [Reply Style](#reply-style-threads-vs-posts)).
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.replyStyle`: per-team override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.requireMention`: per-team override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.tools`: default per-team tool policy overrides (`allow`/`deny`/`alsoAllow`) used when a channel override is missing.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.toolsBySender`: default per-team per-sender tool policy overrides (`"*"` wildcard supported).
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.replyStyle`: per-channel override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.requireMention`: per-channel override.
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.tools`: per-channel tool policy overrides (`allow`/`deny`/`alsoAllow`).
- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.toolsBySender`: per-channel per-sender tool policy overrides (`"*"` wildcard supported).
- `toolsBySender` keys should use explicit prefixes:
  `channel:`, `id:`, `e164:`, `username:`, `name:` (legacy unprefixed keys still map to `id:` only).
- `channels.msteams.actions.memberInfo`: enable or disable the Graph-backed member info action (default: enabled when Graph credentials are available).
- `channels.msteams.authType`: authentication type - `"secret"` (default) or `"federated"`.
- `channels.msteams.certificatePath`: path to PEM certificate file (federated + certificate auth).
- `channels.msteams.certificateThumbprint`: certificate thumbprint (optional, not required for auth).
- `channels.msteams.useManagedIdentity`: enable managed identity auth (federated mode).
- `channels.msteams.managedIdentityClientId`: client ID for user-assigned managed identity.
- `channels.msteams.sharePointSiteId`: SharePoint site ID for file uploads in group chats/channels (see [Sending files in group chats](#sending-files-in-group-chats)).

## Routing and sessions

- Session keys follow the standard agent format (see [/concepts/session](/concepts/session)):
  - Direct messages share the main session (`agent:<agentId>:<mainKey>`).
  - Channel/group messages use conversation id:
    - `agent:<agentId>:msteams:channel:<conversationId>`
    - `agent:<agentId>:msteams:group:<conversationId>`

## Reply style: threads vs posts

Teams recently introduced two channel UI styles over the same underlying data model:

| Style                    | Description                                               | Recommended `replyStyle` |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Posts** (classic)      | Messages appear as cards with threaded replies underneath | `thread` (default)       |
| **Threads** (Slack-like) | Messages flow linearly, more like Slack                   | `top-level`              |

**The problem:** The Teams API does not expose which UI style a channel uses. If you use the wrong `replyStyle`:

- `thread` in a Threads-style channel → replies appear nested awkwardly
- `top-level` in a Posts-style channel → replies appear as separate top-level posts instead of in-thread

**Solution:** Configure `replyStyle` per-channel based on how the channel is set up:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    msteams: {
      replyStyle: "thread",
      teams: {
        "19:abc...@thread.tacv2": {
          channels: {
            "19:xyz...@thread.tacv2": {
              replyStyle: "top-level",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Resolution precedence

When the bot sends a reply into a channel, `replyStyle` is resolved from the most specific override down to the default. The first non-`undefined` value wins:

1. **Per-channel** — `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.replyStyle`
2. **Per-team** — `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.replyStyle`
3. **Global** — `channels.msteams.replyStyle`
4. **Implicit default** — derived from `requireMention`:
   - `requireMention: true` → `thread`
   - `requireMention: false` → `top-level`

If you set `requireMention: false` globally without an explicit `replyStyle`, mentions in Posts-style channels will surface as top-level posts even when the inbound was a thread reply. Pin `replyStyle: "thread"` at the global, team, or channel level to avoid surprises.

### Thread context preservation

When `replyStyle: "thread"` is in effect and the bot was @mentioned from inside a channel thread, OpenClaw re-attaches the original thread root to the outbound conversation reference (`19:…@thread.tacv2;messageid=<root>`) so the reply lands inside the same thread. This holds for both live (in-turn) sends and proactive sends made after the Bot Framework turn context has expired (e.g., long-running agents, queued tool-call replies via `mcp__openclaw__message`).

The thread root is taken from the stored `threadId` on the conversation reference. Older stored references that predate `threadId` fall back to `activityId` (whatever inbound activity last seeded the conversation), so existing deployments keep working without a re-seed.

When `replyStyle: "top-level"` is in effect, channel-thread inbounds are intentionally answered as new top-level posts — no thread suffix is attached. This is the correct behavior for Threads-style channels; if you see top-level posts where you expected threaded replies, your `replyStyle` is set incorrectly for that channel.

## Attachments and images

**Current limitations:**

- **DMs:** Images and file attachments work via Teams bot file APIs.
- **Channels/groups:** Attachments live in M365 storage (SharePoint/OneDrive). The webhook payload only includes an HTML stub, not the actual file bytes. **Graph API permissions are required** to download channel attachments.
- For explicit file-first sends, use `action=upload-file` with `media` / `filePath` / `path`; optional `message` becomes the accompanying text/comment, and `filename` overrides the uploaded name.

Without Graph permissions, channel messages with images will be received as text-only (the image content is not accessible to the bot).
By default, OpenClaw only downloads media from Microsoft/Teams hostnames. Override with `channels.msteams.mediaAllowHosts` (use `["*"]` to allow any host).
Authorization headers are only attached for hosts in `channels.msteams.mediaAuthAllowHosts` (defaults to Graph + Bot Framework hosts). Keep this list strict (avoid multi-tenant suffixes).

## Sending files in group chats

Bots can send files in DMs using the FileConsentCard flow (built-in). However, **sending files in group chats/channels** requires additional setup:

| Context                  | How files are sent                           | Setup needed                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **DMs**                  | FileConsentCard → user accepts → bot uploads | Works out of the box                            |
| **Group chats/channels** | Upload to SharePoint → share link            | Requires `sharePointSiteId` + Graph permissions |
| **Images (any context)** | Base64-encoded inline                        | Works out of the box                            |

### Why group chats need SharePoint

Bots don't have a personal OneDrive drive (the `/me/drive` Graph API endpoint doesn't work for application identities). To send files in group chats/channels, the bot uploads to a **SharePoint site** and creates a sharing link.

### Setup

1. **Add Graph API permissions** in Entra ID (Azure AD) → App Registration:
   - `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (Application) - upload files to SharePoint
   - `Chat.Read.All` (Application) - optional, enables per-user sharing links

2. **Grant admin consent** for the tenant.

3. **Get your SharePoint site ID:**

   ```bash
   # Via Graph Explorer or curl with a valid token:
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{hostname}:/{site-path}"

   # Example: for a site at "contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/BotFiles"
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/contoso.sharepoint.com:/sites/BotFiles"

   # Response includes: "id": "contoso.sharepoint.com,guid1,guid2"
   ```

4. **Configure OpenClaw:**

   ```json5
   {
     channels: {
       msteams: {
         // ... other config ...
         sharePointSiteId: "contoso.sharepoint.com,guid1,guid2",
       },
     },
   }
   ```

### Sharing behavior

| Permission                              | Sharing behavior                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` only              | Organization-wide sharing link (anyone in org can access) |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` + `Chat.Read.All` | Per-user sharing link (only chat members can access)      |

Per-user sharing is more secure as only the chat participants can access the file. If `Chat.Read.All` permission is missing, the bot falls back to organization-wide sharing.

### Fallback behavior

| Scenario                                          | Result                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Group chat + file + `sharePointSiteId` configured | Upload to SharePoint, send sharing link            |
| Group chat + file + no `sharePointSiteId`         | Attempt OneDrive upload (may fail), send text only |
| Personal chat + file                              | FileConsentCard flow (works without SharePoint)    |
| Any context + image                               | Base64-encoded inline (works without SharePoint)   |

### Files stored location

Uploaded files are stored in a `/OpenClawShared/` folder in the configured SharePoint site's default document library.

## Polls (Adaptive Cards)

OpenClaw sends Teams polls as Adaptive Cards (there is no native Teams poll API).

- CLI: `openclaw message poll --channel msteams --target conversation:<id> ...`
- Votes are recorded by the gateway in OpenClaw plugin-state SQLite under `state/openclaw.sqlite`.
- Existing `msteams-polls.json` files are imported once when the MSTeams plugin starts.
- The gateway must stay online to record votes.
- Polls do not auto-post result summaries yet, and there is no supported poll-results CLI yet.

## Presentation cards

Send semantic presentation payloads to Teams users or conversations using the `message` tool, CLI, or normal reply delivery. OpenClaw renders them as Teams Adaptive Cards from the generic presentation contract.

The `presentation` parameter accepts semantic blocks. When `presentation` is provided, the message text is optional. Buttons render as Adaptive Card submit or URL actions. Select menus are not native in the Teams renderer yet, so OpenClaw downgrades them to readable text before delivery.

**Agent tool:**

```json5
{
  action: "send",
  channel: "msteams",
  target: "user:<id>",
  presentation: {
    title: "Hello",
    blocks: [{ type: "text", text: "Hello!" }],
  },
}
```

**CLI:**

```bash
openclaw message send --channel msteams \
  --target "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2" \
  --presentation '{"title":"Hello","blocks":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello!"}]}'
```

For target format details, see [Target formats](#target-formats) below.

## Target formats

MSTeams targets use prefixes to distinguish between users and conversations:

| Target type         | Format                           | Example                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| User (by ID)        | `user:<aad-object-id>`           | `user:40a1a0ed-4ff2-4164-a219-55518990c197`         |
| User (by name)      | `user:<display-name>`            | `user:John Smith` (requires Graph API)              |
| Group/channel       | `conversation:<conversation-id>` | `conversation:19:abc123...@thread.tacv2`            |
| Group/channel (raw) | `<conversation-id>`              | `19:abc123...@thread.tacv2` (if contains `@thread`) |

**CLI examples:**

```bash
# Send to a user by ID
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "user:40a1a0ed-..." --message "Hello"

# Send to a user by display name (triggers Graph API lookup)
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "user:John Smith" --message "Hello"

# Send to a group chat or channel
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2" --message "Hello"

# Send a presentation card to a conversation
openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2" \
  --presentation '{"title":"Hello","blocks":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Agent tool examples:**

```json5
{
  action: "send",
  channel: "msteams",
  target: "user:John Smith",
  message: "Hello!",
}
```

```json5
{
  action: "send",
  channel: "msteams",
  target: "conversation:19:abc...@thread.tacv2",
  presentation: {
    title: "Hello",
    blocks: [{ type: "text", text: "Hello" }],
  },
}
```

<Note>
Without the `user:` prefix, names default to group or team resolution. Always use `user:` when targeting people by display name.
</Note>

## Proactive messaging

- Proactive messages are only possible **after** a user has interacted, because we store conversation references at that point.
- See `/gateway/configuration` for `dmPolicy` and allowlist gating.

## Team and Channel IDs (Common Gotcha)

The `groupId` query parameter in Teams URLs is **NOT** the team ID used for configuration. Extract IDs from the URL path instead:

**Team URL:**

```
https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ABk4j...%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=...
                                    └────────────────────────────┘
                                    Team conversation ID (URL-decode this)
```

**Channel URL:**

```
https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A15bc...%40thread.tacv2/ChannelName?groupId=...
                                      └─────────────────────────┘
                                      Channel ID (URL-decode this)
```

**For config:**

- Team key = path segment after `/team/` (URL-decoded, e.g., `19:Bk4j...@thread.tacv2`; older tenants may show `@thread.skype`, which is also valid)
- Channel key = path segment after `/channel/` (URL-decoded)
- **Ignore** the `groupId` query parameter for OpenClaw routing. It is the Microsoft Entra group ID, not the Bot Framework conversation ID used in incoming Teams activities.

## Private channels

Bots have limited support in private channels:

| Feature                      | Standard Channels | Private Channels       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Bot installation             | Yes               | Limited                |
| Real-time messages (webhook) | Yes               | May not work           |
| RSC permissions              | Yes               | May behave differently |
| @mentions                    | Yes               | If bot is accessible   |
| Graph API history            | Yes               | Yes (with permissions) |

**Workarounds if private channels don't work:**

1. Use standard channels for bot interactions
2. Use DMs - users can always message the bot directly
3. Use Graph API for historical access (requires `ChannelMessage.Read.All`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- **Images not showing in channels:** Graph permissions or admin consent missing. Reinstall the Teams app and fully quit/reopen Teams.
- **No responses in channel:** mentions are required by default; set `channels.msteams.requireMention=false` or configure per team/channel.
- **Version mismatch (Teams still shows old manifest):** remove + re-add the app and fully quit Teams to refresh.
- **401 Unauthorized from webhook:** Expected when testing manually without Azure JWT - means endpoint is reachable but auth failed. Use Azure Web Chat to test properly.

### Manifest upload errors

- **"Icon file cannot be empty":** The manifest references icon files that are 0 bytes. Create valid PNG icons (32x32 for `outline.png`, 192x192 for `color.png`).
- **"webApplicationInfo.Id already in use":** The app is still installed in another team/chat. Find and uninstall it first, or wait 5-10 minutes for propagation.
- **"Something went wrong" on upload:** Upload via [https://admin.teams.microsoft.com](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) instead, open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab, and check the response body for the actual error.
- **Sideload failing:** Try "Upload an app to your org's app catalog" instead of "Upload a custom app" - this often bypasses sideload restrictions.

### RSC permissions not working

1. Verify `webApplicationInfo.id` matches your bot's App ID exactly
2. Re-upload the app and reinstall in the team/chat
3. Check if your org admin has blocked RSC permissions
4. Confirm you're using the right scope: `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` for teams, `ChatMessage.Read.Chat` for group chats

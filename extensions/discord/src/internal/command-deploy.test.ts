/**
 * Regression tests for Discord slash-command reconcile/deploy equality.
 *
 * These protect against a class of bugs where Discord's server-side storage
 * normalization causes our desired descriptor to re-compare unequal to the
 * command Discord returns, which leads to a spurious `PATCH` on every
 * gateway startup and, under the per-application rate limit, a cascade of
 * `429` responses that silently drop some commands until the next restart.

# Web fetch runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-web-fetch
title: Runtime tool fixture — web_fetch
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.web-fetch
objective: Verify web_fetch preserves arguments and result shape across OpenClaw and Codex.
successCriteria:
  - Effective tools expose web_fetch.
  - The mock provider plans exactly one happy-path web_fetch call.
  - The mock provider plans one denied-input failure-path web_fetch call.
  - Runtime parity coverage hard-fails call/result drift in the standard direct-loading gate.

      action: hard gate in the standard direct-loading tier
      reason: web_fetch is an OpenClaw integration tool and must stay visible and callable under OpenClaw and Codex direct runtime parity.

# Sessions spawn runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-sessions-spawn
title: Runtime tool fixture — sessions_spawn
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.sessions-spawn
objective: Verify sessions_spawn preserves arguments and result shape across OpenClaw and Codex.
successCriteria:
  - Effective tools expose sessions_spawn.
  - The mock provider plans exactly one happy-path sessions_spawn call.
  - The mock provider plans one denied-input failure-path sessions_spawn call.
  - Runtime parity coverage hard-fails call/result drift in the standard direct-loading gate.

      action: hard gate in the standard direct-loading tier
      reason: sessions_spawn is an OpenClaw integration tool and must stay visible and callable under OpenClaw and Codex direct runtime parity.

title: "Claude Max API proxy"
---

**claude-max-api-proxy** is a community tool that exposes your Claude Max/Pro subscription as an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. This allows you to use your subscription with any tool that supports the OpenAI API format.

<Warning>
This path is technical compatibility only. Anthropic has blocked some subscription
usage outside Claude Code in the past. You must decide for yourself whether to use
it and verify Anthropic's current billing rules before relying on it.

Anthropic's current support docs say `claude -p` is Agent SDK/programmatic usage.
Starting June 15, 2026, subscription-plan `claude -p` usage draws from a separate
monthly Agent SDK credit first, then from usage credits at standard API rates if
usage credits are enabled.
</Warning>

## Why use this?

| Approach                  | Cost route                                      | Best for                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Anthropic API             | Pay per token through Claude Console or cloud   | Production apps, shared automation, volume |
| Claude subscription proxy | Claude Code / `claude -p` plan and credit rules | Personal experiments with compatible tools |

If you have a Claude Max or Pro subscription and want to use it with
OpenAI-compatible tools, this proxy may fit some personal workflows. It is not an
unlimited flat-rate path. API keys remain the clearer policy and billing path for
production use.

## How it works

```
Your App → claude-max-api-proxy → Claude Code CLI / claude -p → Anthropic
     (OpenAI format)              (converts format)          (uses your login)
```

The proxy:

1. Accepts OpenAI-format requests at `http://localhost:3456/v1/chat/completions`
2. Converts them to Claude Code CLI commands
3. Returns responses in OpenAI format (streaming supported)

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the proxy">
    Requires Node.js 20+ and Claude Code CLI.

    ```bash
    npm install -g claude-max-api-proxy

    # Verify Claude CLI is authenticated
    claude --version
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the server">
    ```bash
    claude-max-api
    # Server runs at http://localhost:3456
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the proxy">
    ```bash
    # Health check
    curl http://localhost:3456/health

    # List models
    curl http://localhost:3456/v1/models

    # Chat completion
    curl http://localhost:3456/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "claude-opus-4",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
      }'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OpenClaw">
    Point OpenClaw at the proxy as a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

    ```json5
    {
      env: {
        OPENAI_API_KEY: "not-needed",
        OPENAI_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:3456/v1",
      },
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          model: { primary: "openai/claude-opus-4" },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Built-in catalog

| Model ID          | Maps To         |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| `claude-opus-4`   | Claude Opus 4   |
| `claude-sonnet-4` | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| `claude-haiku-4`  | Claude Haiku 4  |

## Advanced configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Proxy-style OpenAI-compatible notes">
    This path uses the same proxy-style OpenAI-compatible route as other custom
    `/v1` backends:

    - Native OpenAI-only request shaping does not apply
    - No `service_tier`, no Responses `store`, no prompt-cache hints, and no
      OpenAI reasoning-compat payload shaping
    - Hidden OpenClaw attribution headers (`originator`, `version`, `User-Agent`)
      are not injected on the proxy URL

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-start on macOS with LaunchAgent">
    Create a LaunchAgent to run the proxy automatically:

    ```bash
    cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-max-api.plist << 'EOF'
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
      <key>Label</key>
      <string>com.claude-max-api</string>
      <key>RunAtLoad</key>
      <true/>
      <key>KeepAlive</key>
      <true/>
      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
      <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/node</string>

        <string>/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:~/.local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</string>
      </dict>
    </dict>
    </plist>
    EOF

    launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-max-api.plist
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Notes

- This is a **community tool**, not officially supported by Anthropic or OpenClaw
- Requires an active Claude Max/Pro subscription with Claude Code CLI authenticated
- Inherits Claude Code `claude -p` billing, usage-credit, and rate-limit behavior
- The proxy runs locally and does not send data to any third-party servers
- Streaming responses are fully supported

# File read runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-fs-read
title: Runtime tool fixture — fs.read
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.fs.read
objective: Verify file read behavior is tracked across OpenClaw and Codex while Codex owns read natively.
successCriteria:
  - OpenClaw may expose OpenClaw read while Codex app-server mode may omit duplicate OpenClaw dynamic read.
  - Mock provider read plans are reported as fixture intent, not as actual runtime tool calls.
  - The row stays report-only until failure-path injection proves native Codex read behavior directly.

      action: model native read behavior separately from provider-plan capture
      reason: Codex app-server intentionally owns read natively; QA mock failure-path capture currently reports provider-plan args, not proven Codex native read behavior.
    knownHarnessGap:
      issue: "#80312"
      reason: QA mock failure-path capture currently reports provider-plan args, not proven Codex native read behavior.

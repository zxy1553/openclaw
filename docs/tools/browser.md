title: "Browser (OpenClaw-managed)"
---

OpenClaw can run a **dedicated Chrome/Brave/Edge/Chromium profile** that the agent controls.
It is isolated from your personal browser and is managed through a small local
control service inside the Gateway (loopback only).

Beginner view:

- Think of it as a **separate, agent-only browser**.
- The `openclaw` profile does **not** touch your personal browser profile.
- The agent can **open tabs, read pages, click, and type** in a safe lane.
- The built-in `user` profile attaches to your real signed-in Chrome session via Chrome MCP.

## What you get

- A separate browser profile named **openclaw** (orange accent by default).
- Deterministic tab control (list/open/focus/close).
- Agent actions (click/type/drag/select), snapshots, screenshots, PDFs.
- A bundled `browser-automation` skill that teaches agents the snapshot,
  stable-tab, stale-ref, and manual-blocker recovery loop when the browser
  plugin is enabled.
- Optional multi-profile support (`openclaw`, `work`, `remote`, ...).

This browser is **not** your daily driver. It is a safe, isolated surface for
agent automation and verification.

## Quick start

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw doctor
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw doctor --deep
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw status
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw start
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw open https://example.com
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw snapshot
```

If you get "Browser disabled", enable it in config (see below) and restart the
Gateway.

If `openclaw browser` is missing entirely, or the agent says the browser tool
is unavailable, jump to [Missing browser command or tool](/tools/browser#missing-browser-command-or-tool).

## Plugin control

The default `browser` tool is a bundled plugin. Disable it to replace it with another plugin that registers the same `browser` tool name:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      browser: {
        enabled: false,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Defaults need both `plugins.entries.browser.enabled` **and** `browser.enabled=true`. Disabling only the plugin removes the `openclaw browser` CLI, `browser.request` gateway method, agent tool, and control service as one unit; your `browser.*` config stays intact for a replacement.

Browser config changes require a Gateway restart so the plugin can re-register its service.

## Agent guidance

Tool-profile note: `tools.profile: "coding"` includes `web_search` and
`web_fetch`, but it does not include the full `browser` tool. If the agent or a
spawned sub-agent should use browser automation, add browser at the profile
stage:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    profile: "coding",
    alsoAllow: ["browser"],
  },
}
```

For a single agent, use `agents.list[].tools.alsoAllow: ["browser"]`.
`tools.subagents.tools.allow: ["browser"]` alone is not enough because sub-agent
policy is applied after profile filtering.

The browser plugin ships two levels of agent guidance:

- The `browser` tool description carries the compact always-on contract: pick
  the right profile, keep refs on the same tab, use `tabId`/labels for tab
  targeting, and load the browser skill for multi-step work.
- The bundled `browser-automation` skill carries the longer operating loop:
  check status/tabs first, label task tabs, snapshot before acting, resnapshot
  after UI changes, recover stale refs once, and report login/2FA/captcha or
  camera/microphone blockers as manual action instead of guessing.

Plugin-bundled skills are listed in the agent's available skills when the
plugin is enabled. The full skill instructions are loaded on demand, so routine
turns do not pay the full token cost.

## Missing browser command or tool

If `openclaw browser` is unknown after an upgrade, `browser.request` is missing, or the agent reports the browser tool as unavailable, the usual cause is a `plugins.allow` list that omits `browser` and no root `browser` config block exists. Add it:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    allow: ["telegram", "browser"],
  },
}
```

An explicit root `browser` block, for example `browser.enabled=true` or `browser.profiles.<name>`, activates the bundled browser plugin even under a restrictive `plugins.allow`, matching channel config behavior. `plugins.entries.browser.enabled=true` and `tools.alsoAllow: ["browser"]` do not substitute for allowlist membership by themselves. Removing `plugins.allow` entirely also restores the default.

## Profiles: `openclaw` vs `user`

- `openclaw`: managed, isolated browser (no extension required).
- `user`: built-in Chrome MCP attach profile for your **real signed-in Chrome**
  session.

For agent browser tool calls:

- Default: use the isolated `openclaw` browser.
- Prefer `profile="user"` when existing logged-in sessions matter and the user
  is at the computer to click/approve any attach prompt.
- `profile` is the explicit override when you want a specific browser mode.

Set `browser.defaultProfile: "openclaw"` if you want managed mode by default.

## Configuration

Browser settings live in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

```json5
{
  browser: {
    enabled: true, // default: true
    ssrfPolicy: {
      // dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork: true, // opt in only for trusted private-network access
      // allowPrivateNetwork: true, // legacy alias
      // hostnameAllowlist: ["*.example.com", "example.com"],
      // allowedHostnames: ["localhost"],
    },
    // cdpUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:18792", // legacy single-profile override
    remoteCdpTimeoutMs: 1500, // remote CDP HTTP timeout (ms)
    remoteCdpHandshakeTimeoutMs: 3000, // remote CDP WebSocket handshake timeout (ms)
    localLaunchTimeoutMs: 15000, // local managed Chrome discovery timeout (ms)
    localCdpReadyTimeoutMs: 8000, // local managed post-launch CDP readiness timeout (ms)
    actionTimeoutMs: 60000, // default browser act timeout (ms)
    tabCleanup: {
      enabled: true, // default: true
      idleMinutes: 120, // set 0 to disable idle cleanup
      maxTabsPerSession: 8, // set 0 to disable the per-session cap
      sweepMinutes: 5,
    },
    defaultProfile: "openclaw",
    color: "#FF4500",
    headless: false,
    noSandbox: false,
    attachOnly: false,
    executablePath: "/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser",
    profiles: {
      openclaw: { cdpPort: 18800, color: "#FF4500" },
      work: {
        cdpPort: 18801,
        color: "#0066CC",
        headless: true,
        executablePath: "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome",
      },
      user: {
        driver: "existing-session",
        attachOnly: true,
        color: "#00AA00",
      },
      brave: {
        driver: "existing-session",
        attachOnly: true,
        userDataDir: "~/Library/Application Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser",
        color: "#FB542B",
      },
      remote: { cdpUrl: "http://10.0.0.42:9222", color: "#00AA00" },
    },
  },
}
```

### Screenshot vision (text-only model support)

When the main model is text-only (no vision/multimodal support), browser
screenshots return image blocks that the model cannot read. Browser screenshots
reuse the existing image-understanding configuration, so an image model
configured for media understanding can describe screenshots as text without any
browser-specific model settings.

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      image: {
        models: [
          { provider: "bytedance", model: "doubao-seed-2.0-pro" },
          // Add fallback candidates; first success wins
          { provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o" },
        ],
      },
      // Shared media models also work when tagged for image support.
      // models: [{ provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o", capabilities: ["image"] }],
    },
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      // Existing image-model defaults are also honored.
      // imageModel: { primary: "openai/gpt-4o" },
    },
  },
}
```

**How it works:**

1. Agent calls `browser screenshot` → image captured to disk as usual.
2. The browser tool asks the existing image-understanding runtime whether it
   can describe the screenshot using configured media image models, shared media
   models, image-model defaults, or an auth-backed image provider.
3. The vision model returns a text description, which is wrapped with
   `wrapExternalContent` (prompt injection guard) and returned to the agent
   as a text block instead of an image block.
4. If image understanding is unavailable, skipped, or fails, the browser falls
   back to returning the original image block.

Use the existing `tools.media.image` / `tools.media.models` fields for model
fallbacks, timeouts, byte limits, profiles, and provider request settings.

If the active main model already supports vision and no explicit image
understanding model is configured, OpenClaw keeps the normal image result so the
main model can read the screenshot directly.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Ports and reachability">

- Control service binds to loopback on a port derived from `gateway.port` (default `18791` = gateway + 2). Overriding `gateway.port` or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` shifts the derived ports in the same family.
- Local `openclaw` profiles auto-assign `cdpPort`/`cdpUrl`; set those only for remote CDP. `cdpUrl` defaults to the managed local CDP port when unset.
- `remoteCdpTimeoutMs` applies to remote and `attachOnly` CDP HTTP reachability
  checks and tab-opening HTTP requests; `remoteCdpHandshakeTimeoutMs` applies to
  their CDP WebSocket handshakes.
- `localLaunchTimeoutMs` is the budget for a locally launched managed Chrome
  process to expose its CDP HTTP endpoint. `localCdpReadyTimeoutMs` is the
  follow-up budget for CDP websocket readiness after the process is discovered.
  Raise these on Raspberry Pi, low-end VPS, or older hardware where Chromium
  starts slowly. Values must be positive integers up to `120000` ms; invalid
  config values are rejected.
- Repeated managed Chrome launch/readiness failures are circuit-broken per
  profile. After several consecutive failures, OpenClaw pauses new launch
  attempts briefly instead of spawning Chromium on every browser tool call. Fix
  the startup problem, disable the browser if it is not needed, or restart the
  Gateway after repair.
- `actionTimeoutMs` is the default budget for browser `act` requests when the caller does not pass `timeoutMs`. The client transport adds a small slack window so long waits can finish instead of timing out at the HTTP boundary.
- `tabCleanup` is best-effort cleanup for tabs opened by primary-agent browser sessions. Subagent, cron, and ACP lifecycle cleanup still closes their explicit tracked tabs at session end; primary sessions keep active tabs reusable, then close idle or excess tracked tabs in the background.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SSRF policy">

- Browser navigation and open-tab are SSRF-guarded before navigation and best-effort re-checked on the final `http(s)` URL afterwards.
- In strict SSRF mode, remote CDP endpoint discovery and `/json/version` probes (`cdpUrl`) are checked too.
- Gateway/provider `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables do not automatically proxy the OpenClaw-managed browser. Managed Chrome launches direct by default so provider proxy settings do not weaken browser SSRF checks.
- OpenClaw-managed local CDP readiness probes and DevTools WebSocket connections bypass the managed network proxy for the exact launched loopback endpoint, so `openclaw browser start` still works when an operator proxy blocks loopback egress.
- To proxy the managed browser itself, pass explicit Chrome proxy flags through `browser.extraArgs`, such as `--proxy-server=...` or `--proxy-pac-url=...`. Strict SSRF mode blocks explicit browser proxy routing unless private-network browser access is intentionally enabled.
- `browser.ssrfPolicy.dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork` is off by default; enable only when private-network browser access is intentionally trusted.
- `browser.ssrfPolicy.allowPrivateNetwork` remains supported as a legacy alias.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Profile behavior">

- `attachOnly: true` means never launch a local browser; only attach if one is already running.
- `headless` can be set globally or per local managed profile. Per-profile values override `browser.headless`, so one locally launched profile can stay headless while another remains visible.
- `POST /start?headless=true` and `openclaw browser start --headless` request a
  one-shot headless launch for local managed profiles without rewriting
  `browser.headless` or profile config. Existing-session, attach-only, and
  remote CDP profiles reject the override because OpenClaw does not launch those
  browser processes.
- On Linux hosts without `DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, local managed profiles
  default to headless automatically when neither the environment nor profile/global
  config explicitly chooses headed mode. `openclaw browser status --json`
  reports `headlessSource` as `env`, `profile`, `config`,
  `request`, `linux-display-fallback`, or `default`.
- `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_HEADLESS=1` forces local managed launches headless for the
  current process. `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_HEADLESS=0` forces headed mode for ordinary
  starts and returns an actionable error on Linux hosts without a display server;
  an explicit `start --headless` request still wins for that one launch.
- `executablePath` can be set globally or per local managed profile. Per-profile values override `browser.executablePath`, so different managed profiles can launch different Chromium-based browsers. Both forms accept `~` for your OS home directory.
- `color` (top-level and per-profile) tints the browser UI so you can see which profile is active.
- Default profile is `openclaw` (managed standalone). Use `defaultProfile: "user"` to opt into the signed-in user browser.
- Auto-detect order: system default browser if Chromium-based; otherwise Chrome → Brave → Edge → Chromium → Chrome Canary.
- `driver: "existing-session"` uses Chrome DevTools MCP instead of raw CDP. Do not set `cdpUrl` for that driver.
- Set `browser.profiles.<name>.userDataDir` when an existing-session profile should attach to a non-default Chromium user profile (Brave, Edge, etc.). This path also accepts `~` for your OS home directory.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Use Brave or another Chromium-based browser

If your **system default** browser is Chromium-based (Chrome/Brave/Edge/etc),
OpenClaw uses it automatically. Set `browser.executablePath` to override
auto-detection. Top-level and per-profile `executablePath` values accept `~`
for your OS home directory:

```bash
openclaw config set browser.executablePath "/usr/bin/google-chrome"
openclaw config set browser.profiles.work.executablePath "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
```

Or set it in config, per platform:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
```json5
{
  browser: {
    executablePath: "/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser",
  },
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```json5
{
  browser: {
    executablePath: "C:\\Program Files\\BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\Application\\brave.exe",
  },
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
```json5
{
  browser: {
    executablePath: "/usr/bin/brave-browser",
  },
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Per-profile `executablePath` only affects local managed profiles that OpenClaw
launches. `existing-session` profiles attach to an already-running browser
instead, and remote CDP profiles use the browser behind `cdpUrl`.

## Local vs remote control

- **Local control (default):** the Gateway starts the loopback control service and can launch a local browser.
- **Remote control (node host):** run a node host on the machine that has the browser; the Gateway proxies browser actions to it.
- **Remote CDP:** set `browser.profiles.<name>.cdpUrl` (or `browser.cdpUrl`) to
  attach to a remote Chromium-based browser. In this case, OpenClaw will not launch a local browser.
- For externally managed CDP services on loopback (for example Browserless in
  Docker published to `127.0.0.1`), also set `attachOnly: true`. Loopback CDP
  without `attachOnly` is treated as a local OpenClaw-managed browser profile.
- `headless` only affects local managed profiles that OpenClaw launches. It does not restart or change existing-session or remote CDP browsers.
- `executablePath` follows the same local managed profile rule. Changing it on a
  running local managed profile marks that profile for restart/reconcile so the
  next launch uses the new binary.

Stopping behavior differs by profile mode:

- local managed profiles: `openclaw browser stop` stops the browser process that
  OpenClaw launched
- attach-only and remote CDP profiles: `openclaw browser stop` closes the active
  control session and releases Playwright/CDP emulation overrides (viewport,
  color scheme, locale, timezone, offline mode, and similar state), even
  though no browser process was launched by OpenClaw

Remote CDP URLs can include auth:

- Query tokens (e.g., `https://provider.example?token=<token>`)
- HTTP Basic auth (e.g., `https://user:pass@provider.example`)

OpenClaw preserves the auth when calling `/json/*` endpoints and when connecting
to the CDP WebSocket. Prefer environment variables or secrets managers for
tokens instead of committing them to config files.

## Node browser proxy (zero-config default)

If you run a **node host** on the machine that has your browser, OpenClaw can
auto-route browser tool calls to that node without any extra browser config.
This is the default path for remote gateways.

Notes:

- The node host exposes its local browser control server via a **proxy command**.
- Profiles come from the node's own `browser.profiles` config (same as local).
- `nodeHost.browserProxy.allowProfiles` is optional. Leave it empty for the legacy/default behavior: all configured profiles remain reachable through the proxy, including profile create/delete routes.
- If you set `nodeHost.browserProxy.allowProfiles`, OpenClaw treats it as a least-privilege boundary: only allowlisted profiles can be targeted, and persistent profile create/delete routes are blocked on the proxy surface.
- Disable if you don't want it:
  - On the node: `nodeHost.browserProxy.enabled=false`
  - On the gateway: `gateway.nodes.browser.mode="off"`

## Browserless (hosted remote CDP)

[Browserless](https://browserless.io) is a hosted Chromium service that exposes
CDP connection URLs over HTTPS and WebSocket. OpenClaw can use either form, but
for a remote browser profile the simplest option is the direct WebSocket URL
from Browserless' connection docs.

Example:

```json5
{
  browser: {
    enabled: true,
    defaultProfile: "browserless",
    remoteCdpTimeoutMs: 2000,
    remoteCdpHandshakeTimeoutMs: 4000,
    profiles: {
      browserless: {
        cdpUrl: "wss://production-sfo.browserless.io?token=<BROWSERLESS_API_KEY>",
        color: "#00AA00",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Notes:

- Replace `<BROWSERLESS_API_KEY>` with your real Browserless token.
- Choose the region endpoint that matches your Browserless account (see their docs).
- If Browserless gives you an HTTPS base URL, you can either convert it to
  `wss://` for a direct CDP connection or keep the HTTPS URL and let OpenClaw
  discover `/json/version`.

### Browserless Docker on the same host

When Browserless is self-hosted in Docker and OpenClaw runs on the host, treat
Browserless as an externally managed CDP service:

```json5
{
  browser: {
    enabled: true,
    defaultProfile: "browserless",
    profiles: {
      browserless: {
        cdpUrl: "ws://127.0.0.1:3000",
        attachOnly: true,
        color: "#00AA00",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The address in `browser.profiles.browserless.cdpUrl` must be reachable from the
OpenClaw process. Browserless must also advertise a matching reachable endpoint;
set Browserless `EXTERNAL` to that same public-to-OpenClaw WebSocket base, such
as `ws://127.0.0.1:3000`, `ws://browserless:3000`, or a stable private Docker
network address. If `/json/version` returns `webSocketDebuggerUrl` pointing at
an address OpenClaw cannot reach, CDP HTTP can look healthy while the WebSocket
attach still fails.

Do not leave `attachOnly` unset for a loopback Browserless profile. Without
`attachOnly`, OpenClaw treats the loopback port as a local managed browser
profile and may report that the port is in use but not owned by OpenClaw.

## Direct WebSocket CDP providers

Some hosted browser services expose a **direct WebSocket** endpoint rather than
the standard HTTP-based CDP discovery (`/json/version`). OpenClaw accepts three
CDP URL shapes and picks the right connection strategy automatically:

- **HTTP(S) discovery** - `http://host[:port]` or `https://host[:port]`.
  OpenClaw calls `/json/version` to discover the WebSocket debugger URL, then
  connects. No WebSocket fallback.
- **Direct WebSocket endpoints** - `ws://host[:port]/devtools/<kind>/<id>` or
  `wss://...` with a `/devtools/browser|page|worker|shared_worker|service_worker/<id>`
  path. OpenClaw connects directly via a WebSocket handshake and skips
  `/json/version` entirely.
- **Bare WebSocket roots** - `ws://host[:port]` or `wss://host[:port]` with no
  `/devtools/...` path (e.g. [Browserless](https://browserless.io),
  [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com)). OpenClaw tries HTTP
  `/json/version` discovery first (normalising the scheme to `http`/`https`);
  if discovery returns a `webSocketDebuggerUrl` it is used, otherwise OpenClaw
  falls back to a direct WebSocket handshake at the bare root. If the advertised
  WebSocket endpoint rejects the CDP handshake but the configured bare root
  accepts it, OpenClaw falls back to that root as well. This lets a bare `ws://`
  pointed at a local Chrome still connect, since Chrome only accepts WebSocket
  upgrades on the specific per-target path from `/json/version`, while hosted
  providers can still use their root WebSocket endpoint when their discovery
  endpoint advertises a short-lived URL that is not suitable for Playwright CDP.

`openclaw browser doctor` uses the same discovery-first, WebSocket-fallback
logic as runtime attach, so a bare-root URL that connects successfully is not
reported as unreachable by diagnostics.

### Browserbase

[Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com) is a cloud platform for running
headless browsers with built-in CAPTCHA solving, stealth mode, and residential
proxies.

```json5
{
  browser: {
    enabled: true,
    defaultProfile: "browserbase",
    remoteCdpTimeoutMs: 3000,
    remoteCdpHandshakeTimeoutMs: 5000,
    profiles: {
      browserbase: {
        cdpUrl: "wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=<BROWSERBASE_API_KEY>",
        color: "#F97316",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Notes:

- [Sign up](https://www.browserbase.com/sign-up) and copy your **API Key**
  from the [Overview dashboard](https://www.browserbase.com/overview).
- Replace `<BROWSERBASE_API_KEY>` with your real Browserbase API key.
- Browserbase auto-creates a browser session on WebSocket connect, so no
  manual session creation step is needed.
- The free tier allows one concurrent session and one browser hour per month.
  See [pricing](https://www.browserbase.com/pricing) for paid plan limits.
- See the [Browserbase docs](https://docs.browserbase.com) for full API
  reference, SDK guides, and integration examples.

### Notte

[Notte](https://www.notte.cc) is a cloud platform for running headless
browsers with built-in stealth, residential proxies, and a CDP-native
WebSocket gateway.

```json5
{
  browser: {
    enabled: true,
    defaultProfile: "notte",
    remoteCdpTimeoutMs: 3000,
    remoteCdpHandshakeTimeoutMs: 5000,
    profiles: {
      notte: {
        cdpUrl: "wss://us-prod.notte.cc/sessions/connect?token=<NOTTE_API_KEY>",
        color: "#7C3AED",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Notes:

- [Sign up](https://console.notte.cc) and copy your **API Key** from the
  console settings page.
- Replace `<NOTTE_API_KEY>` with your real Notte API key.
- Notte auto-creates a browser session on WebSocket connect, so no manual
  session creation step is needed. The session is destroyed when the
  WebSocket disconnects.
- The free tier allows five concurrent sessions and 100 lifetime browser
  hours. See [pricing](https://www.notte.cc/#pricing) for paid plan limits.
- See the [Notte docs](https://docs.notte.cc) for full API reference, SDK
  guides, and integration examples.

## Security

Key ideas:

- Browser control is loopback-only; access flows through the Gateway's auth or node pairing.
- The standalone loopback browser HTTP API uses **shared-secret auth only**:
  gateway token bearer auth, `x-openclaw-password`, or HTTP Basic auth with the
  configured gateway password.
- Tailscale Serve identity headers and `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"` do
  **not** authenticate this standalone loopback browser API.
- If browser control is enabled and no shared-secret auth is configured, OpenClaw
  generates a runtime-only gateway token for that startup. Configure
  `gateway.auth.token`, `gateway.auth.password`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, or
  `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` explicitly if clients need a stable secret across
  restarts.
- OpenClaw does **not** auto-generate that token when `gateway.auth.mode` is
  already `password`, `none`, or `trusted-proxy`.
- Keep the Gateway and any node hosts on a private network (Tailscale); avoid public exposure.
- Treat remote CDP URLs/tokens as secrets; prefer env vars or a secrets manager.

Remote CDP tips:

- Prefer encrypted endpoints (HTTPS or WSS) and short-lived tokens where possible.
- Avoid embedding long-lived tokens directly in config files.

## Profiles (multi-browser)

OpenClaw supports multiple named profiles (routing configs). Profiles can be:

- **openclaw-managed**: a dedicated Chromium-based browser instance with its own user data directory + CDP port
- **remote**: an explicit CDP URL (Chromium-based browser running elsewhere)
- **existing session**: your existing Chrome profile via Chrome DevTools MCP auto-connect

Defaults:

- The `openclaw` profile is auto-created if missing.
- The `user` profile is built-in for Chrome MCP existing-session attach.
- Existing-session profiles are opt-in beyond `user`; create them with `--driver existing-session`.
- Local CDP ports allocate from **18800-18899** by default.
- Deleting a profile moves its local data directory to Trash.

All control endpoints accept `?profile=<name>`; the CLI uses `--browser-profile`.

## Existing session via Chrome DevTools MCP

OpenClaw can also attach to a running Chromium-based browser profile through the
official Chrome DevTools MCP server. This reuses the tabs and login state
already open in that browser profile.

Official background and setup references:

- [Chrome for Developers: Use Chrome DevTools MCP with your browser session](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp-debug-your-browser-session)
- [Chrome DevTools MCP README](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp)

Built-in profile:

- `user`

Optional: create your own custom existing-session profile if you want a
different name, color, or browser data directory.

Default behavior:

- The built-in `user` profile uses Chrome MCP auto-connect, which targets the
  default local Google Chrome profile.

Use `userDataDir` for Brave, Edge, Chromium, or a non-default Chrome profile.
`~` expands to your OS home directory:

```json5
{
  browser: {
    profiles: {
      brave: {
        driver: "existing-session",
        attachOnly: true,
        userDataDir: "~/Library/Application Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser",
        color: "#FB542B",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Then in the matching browser:

1. Open that browser's inspect page for remote debugging.
2. Enable remote debugging.
3. Keep the browser running and approve the connection prompt when OpenClaw attaches.

Common inspect pages:

- Chrome: `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging`
- Brave: `brave://inspect/#remote-debugging`
- Edge: `edge://inspect/#remote-debugging`

Live attach smoke test:

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile user start
openclaw browser --browser-profile user status
openclaw browser --browser-profile user tabs
openclaw browser --browser-profile user snapshot --format ai
```

What success looks like:

- `status` shows `driver: existing-session`
- `status` shows `transport: chrome-mcp`
- `status` shows `running: true`
- `tabs` lists your already-open browser tabs
- `snapshot` returns refs from the selected live tab

What to check if attach does not work:

- the target Chromium-based browser is version `144+`
- remote debugging is enabled in that browser's inspect page
- the browser showed and you accepted the attach consent prompt
- `openclaw doctor` migrates old extension-based browser config and checks that
  Chrome is installed locally for default auto-connect profiles, but it cannot
  enable browser-side remote debugging for you

Agent use:

- Use `profile="user"` when you need the user's logged-in browser state.
- If you use a custom existing-session profile, pass that explicit profile name.
- Only choose this mode when the user is at the computer to approve the attach
  prompt.
- the Gateway or node host can spawn `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --autoConnect`

Notes:

- This path is higher-risk than the isolated `openclaw` profile because it can
  act inside your signed-in browser session.
- OpenClaw does not launch the browser for this driver; it only attaches.
- OpenClaw uses the official Chrome DevTools MCP `--autoConnect` flow here. If
  `userDataDir` is set, it is passed through to target that user data directory.
- Existing-session can attach on the selected host or through a connected
  browser node. If Chrome lives elsewhere and no browser node is connected, use
  remote CDP or a node host instead.

### Custom Chrome MCP launch

Override the spawned Chrome DevTools MCP server per profile when the default
`npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` flow is not what you want (offline hosts,
pinned versions, vendored binaries):

| Field        | What it does                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mcpCommand` | Executable to spawn instead of `npx`. Resolved as-is; absolute paths are honored.                                          |
| `mcpArgs`    | Argument array passed verbatim to `mcpCommand`. Replaces the default `chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --autoConnect` arguments. |

When `cdpUrl` is set on an existing-session profile, OpenClaw skips
`--autoConnect` and forwards the endpoint to Chrome MCP automatically:

- `http(s)://...` → `--browserUrl <url>` (DevTools HTTP discovery endpoint).
- `ws(s)://...` → `--wsEndpoint <url>` (direct CDP WebSocket).

Endpoint flags and `userDataDir` cannot be combined: when `cdpUrl` is set,
`userDataDir` is ignored for Chrome MCP launch, since Chrome MCP attaches to
the running browser behind the endpoint rather than opening a profile
directory.

<Accordion title="Existing-session feature limitations">

Compared to the managed `openclaw` profile, existing-session drivers are more constrained:

- **Screenshots** - page captures and `--ref` element captures work; CSS `--element` selectors do not. `--full-page` cannot combine with `--ref` or `--element`. Playwright is not required for page or ref-based element screenshots.
- **Actions** - `click`, `type`, `hover`, `scrollIntoView`, `drag`, and `select` require snapshot refs (no CSS selectors). `click-coords` clicks visible viewport coordinates and does not require a snapshot ref. `click` is left-button only. `type` does not support `slowly=true`; use `fill` or `press`. `press` does not support `delayMs`. `type`, `hover`, `scrollIntoView`, `drag`, `select`, `fill`, and `evaluate` do not support per-call timeouts. `select` accepts a single value.
- **Wait / upload / dialog** - `wait --url` supports exact, substring, and glob patterns; `wait --load networkidle` is not supported. Upload hooks require `ref` or `inputRef`, one file at a time, no CSS `element`. Dialog hooks do not support timeout overrides or `dialogId`.
- **Dialog visibility** - Managed browser action responses include `blockedByDialog` and `browserState.dialogs.pending` when an action opens a modal dialog; snapshots also include pending dialog state. Respond with `browser dialog --accept/--dismiss --dialog-id <id>` while a dialog is pending. Dialogs handled outside OpenClaw appear under `browserState.dialogs.recent`.
- **Managed-only features** - batch actions, PDF export, download interception, and `responsebody` still require the managed browser path.

## Isolation guarantees

- **Dedicated user data dir**: never touches your personal browser profile.
- **Dedicated ports**: avoids `9222` to prevent collisions with dev workflows.
- **Deterministic tab control**: `tabs` returns `suggestedTargetId` first, then
  stable `tabId` handles such as `t1`, optional labels, and the raw `targetId`.
  Agents should reuse `suggestedTargetId`; raw ids remain available for
  debugging and compatibility.

## Browser selection

When launching locally, OpenClaw picks the first available:

1. Chrome
2. Brave
3. Edge
4. Chromium
5. Chrome Canary

You can override with `browser.executablePath`.

Platforms:

- macOS: checks `/Applications` and `~/Applications`.
- Linux: checks common Chrome/Brave/Edge/Chromium locations under `/usr/bin`,
  `/snap/bin`, `/opt/google`, `/opt/brave.com`, `/usr/lib/chromium`, and
  `/usr/lib/chromium-browser`, plus Playwright-managed Chromium under
  `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` or `~/.cache/ms-playwright`.
- Windows: checks common install locations.

## Control API (optional)

For scripting and debugging, the Gateway exposes a small **loopback-only HTTP
control API** plus a matching `openclaw browser` CLI (snapshots, refs, wait
power-ups, JSON output, debug workflows). See
[Browser control API](/tools/browser-control) for the full reference.

### CDP startup failure vs navigation SSRF block

These are different failure classes and they point to different code paths.

- **CDP startup or readiness failure** means OpenClaw cannot confirm that the browser control plane is healthy.
- **Navigation SSRF block** means the browser control plane is healthy, but a page navigation target is rejected by policy.

Common examples:

- CDP startup or readiness failure:
  - `Chrome CDP websocket for profile "openclaw" is not reachable after start`
  - `Remote CDP for profile "<name>" is not reachable at <cdpUrl>`
  - `Port <port> is in use for profile "<name>" but not by openclaw` when a
    loopback external CDP service is configured without `attachOnly: true`
- Navigation SSRF block:
  - `open`, `navigate`, snapshot, or tab-opening flows fail with a browser/network policy error while `start` and `tabs` still work

Use this minimal sequence to separate the two:

```bash
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw start
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw tabs
openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw open https://example.com
```

How to read the results:

- If `start` fails with `not reachable after start`, troubleshoot CDP readiness first.
- If `start` succeeds but `tabs` fails, the control plane is still unhealthy. Treat this as a CDP reachability problem, not a page-navigation problem.
- If `start` and `tabs` succeed but `open` or `navigate` fails, the browser control plane is up and the failure is in navigation policy or the target page.
- If `start`, `tabs`, and `open` all succeed, the basic managed-browser control path is healthy.

Important behavior details:

- Browser config defaults to a fail-closed SSRF policy object even when you do not configure `browser.ssrfPolicy`.
- For the local loopback `openclaw` managed profile, CDP health checks intentionally skip browser SSRF reachability enforcement for OpenClaw's own local control plane.
- Navigation protection is separate. A successful `start` or `tabs` result does not mean a later `open` or `navigate` target is allowed.

Security guidance:

- Do **not** relax browser SSRF policy by default.
- Prefer narrow host exceptions such as `hostnameAllowlist` or `allowedHostnames` over broad private-network access.
- Use `dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork: true` only in intentionally trusted environments where private-network browser access is required and reviewed.

## Agent tools + how control works

The agent gets **one tool** for browser automation:

- `browser` - doctor/status/start/stop/tabs/open/focus/close/snapshot/screenshot/navigate/act

How it maps:

- `browser snapshot` returns a stable UI tree (AI or ARIA).
- `browser act` uses the snapshot `ref` IDs to click/type/drag/select.
- `browser screenshot` captures pixels (full page, element, or labeled refs).
- `browser doctor` checks Gateway, plugin, profile, browser, and tab readiness.
- `browser` accepts:
  - `profile` to choose a named browser profile (openclaw, chrome, or remote CDP).
  - `target` (`sandbox` | `host` | `node`) to select where the browser lives.
  - In sandboxed sessions, `target: "host"` requires `agents.defaults.sandbox.browser.allowHostControl=true`.
  - If `target` is omitted: sandboxed sessions default to `sandbox`, non-sandbox sessions default to `host`.
  - If a browser-capable node is connected, the tool may auto-route to it unless you pin `target="host"` or `target="node"`.

This keeps the agent deterministic and avoids brittle selectors.

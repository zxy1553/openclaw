title: "Admin HTTP RPC plugin"
---

The bundled `admin-http-rpc` plugin exposes selected Gateway control-plane methods over HTTP for trusted host automation that cannot use the normal Gateway WebSocket RPC client.

The plugin is included with OpenClaw, but it is off by default. When disabled, the route is not registered. When enabled, it adds:

- `POST /api/v1/admin/rpc`
- same listener as the Gateway: `http://<gateway-host>:<port>/api/v1/admin/rpc`

Enable it only for private host tooling, tailnet automation, or a trusted internal ingress. Do not expose this route directly to the public internet.

## Before you enable it

Admin HTTP RPC is a full operator control-plane surface. Any caller that passes Gateway HTTP auth can invoke the allowlisted methods on this page.

Use it when all of these are true:

- The caller is trusted to operate the Gateway.
- The caller cannot use the WebSocket RPC client.
- The route is reachable only on loopback, a tailnet, or a private authenticated ingress.
- You have reviewed the allowed methods and they match the automation you plan to run.

Use the WebSocket RPC path for OpenClaw clients and interactive tools that can keep a Gateway WebSocket connection open.

## Enable

Enable the bundled plugin:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
    openclaw plugins enable admin-http-rpc
    openclaw gateway restart
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Config">
    ```json5
    {
      plugins: {
        entries: {
          "admin-http-rpc": { enabled: true },
        },
      },
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The route is registered during plugin startup. Restart the Gateway after changing plugin config.

Disable it when you no longer need the HTTP surface:

```bash
openclaw plugins disable admin-http-rpc
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Verify the route

Use `health` as the smallest safe request:

```bash
curl -sS http://<gateway-host>:<port>/api/v1/admin/rpc \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <gateway-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"method":"health","params":{}}'
```

A successful response has `ok: true`:

```json
{
  "id": "generated-request-id",
  "ok": true,
  "payload": {
    "status": "ok"
  }
}
```

When the plugin is disabled, the route returns `404` because it is not registered.

## Authentication

The plugin route uses Gateway HTTP auth.

Common authentication paths:

- shared-secret auth (`gateway.auth.mode="token"` or `"password"`): `Authorization: Bearer <token-or-password>`
- trusted identity-bearing HTTP auth (`gateway.auth.mode="trusted-proxy"`): route through the configured identity-aware proxy and let it inject the required identity headers
- private-ingress open auth (`gateway.auth.mode="none"`): no auth header required

## Security model

Treat this plugin as a full Gateway operator surface.

- Enabling the plugin intentionally offers access to the allowlisted admin RPC methods at `/api/v1/admin/rpc`.
- The plugin declares the reserved `contracts.gatewayMethodDispatch: ["authenticated-request"]` manifest contract so its Gateway-authenticated HTTP route can dispatch control-plane methods in process.
- Shared-secret bearer auth proves possession of the gateway operator secret.
- For `token` and `password` auth, narrower `x-openclaw-scopes` headers are ignored and the normal full operator defaults are restored.
- Trusted identity-bearing HTTP modes honor `x-openclaw-scopes` when present.
- `gateway.auth.mode="none"` means this route is unauthenticated if the plugin is enabled. Use that only behind a private ingress you fully trust.
- Requests dispatch through the same Gateway method handlers and scope checks as WebSocket RPC after the plugin route auth passes.
- Keep this route on loopback, tailnet, or a private trusted ingress. Do not expose it directly to the public internet.
- Plugin manifest contracts are not a sandbox. They prevent accidental use of reserved SDK helpers; trusted plugins still run in the Gateway process.

Use separate gateways when callers cross trust boundaries.

## Request

```http
POST /api/v1/admin/rpc
Authorization: Bearer <gateway-token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "id": "optional-request-id",
  "method": "health",
  "params": {}
}
```

Fields:

- `id` (string, optional): copied into the response. A UUID is generated when omitted.
- `method` (string, required): allowed Gateway method name.
- `params` (any, optional): method-specific params.

The default max request body size is 1 MB.

## Response

Success responses use the Gateway RPC shape:

```json
{
  "id": "optional-request-id",
  "ok": true,
  "payload": {}
}
```

Gateway method errors use:

```json
{
  "id": "optional-request-id",
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "bad params"
  }
}
```

HTTP status follows the Gateway error when possible. For example, `INVALID_REQUEST` returns `400`, and `UNAVAILABLE` returns `503`.

## Allowed methods

- discovery: `commands.list`
  Returns the HTTP RPC method names allowed by this plugin.
- gateway: `health`, `status`, `logs.tail`, `usage.status`, `usage.cost`, `gateway.restart.request`
- config: `config.get`, `config.schema`, `config.schema.lookup`, `config.set`, `config.patch`, `config.apply`
- channels: `channels.status`, `channels.start`, `channels.stop`, `channels.logout`
- web: `web.login.start`, `web.login.wait`
- models: `models.list`, `models.authStatus`
- agents: `agents.list`, `agents.create`, `agents.update`, `agents.delete`
- approvals: `exec.approvals.get`, `exec.approvals.set`, `exec.approvals.node.get`, `exec.approvals.node.set`
- cron: `cron.status`, `cron.list`, `cron.get`, `cron.runs`, `cron.add`, `cron.update`, `cron.remove`, `cron.run`
- devices: `device.pair.list`, `device.pair.approve`, `device.pair.reject`, `device.pair.remove`
- nodes: `node.list`, `node.describe`, `node.pair.list`, `node.pair.approve`, `node.pair.reject`, `node.pair.remove`, `node.rename`
- tasks: `tasks.list`, `tasks.get`, `tasks.cancel`
- diagnostics: `doctor.memory.status`, `update.status`

Other Gateway methods are blocked until they are intentionally added.

## WebSocket comparison

The normal Gateway WebSocket RPC path remains the preferred control-plane API for OpenClaw clients. Use admin HTTP RPC only for host tooling that needs a request/response HTTP surface.

Shared-token WebSocket clients without a trusted device identity cannot self-declare admin scopes during connect. Admin HTTP RPC deliberately follows the existing trusted HTTP operator model: when the plugin is enabled, shared-secret bearer auth is treated as full operator access for this admin surface.

## Troubleshooting

`404 Not Found`

: The plugin is disabled, the Gateway has not restarted since enabling it, or the request is going to a different Gateway process.

`401 Unauthorized`

: The request did not satisfy Gateway HTTP auth. Check the bearer token or the trusted-proxy identity headers.

`400 INVALID_REQUEST`

: The request body is not valid JSON, the `method` field is missing, or the method is not in the plugin allowlist.

`503 UNAVAILABLE`

: The Gateway method handler is unavailable. Check Gateway logs and retry after the Gateway finishes startup.

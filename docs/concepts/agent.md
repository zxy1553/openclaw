title: "Agent runtime"
---

OpenClaw runs a **single embedded agent runtime** - one agent process per
Gateway, with its own workspace, bootstrap files, and session store. This page
covers that runtime contract: what the workspace must contain, which files get
injected, and how sessions bootstrap against it.

## Workspace (required)

OpenClaw uses a single agent workspace directory (`agents.defaults.workspace`) as the agent's **only** working directory (`cwd`) for tools and context.

Recommended: use `openclaw setup` to create `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` if missing and initialize the workspace files.

Full workspace layout + backup guide: [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace)

If `agents.defaults.sandbox` is enabled, non-main sessions can override this with
per-session workspaces under `agents.defaults.sandbox.workspaceRoot` (see
[Gateway configuration](/gateway/configuration)).

## Bootstrap files (injected)

Inside `agents.defaults.workspace`, OpenClaw expects these user-editable files:

- `AGENTS.md` - operating instructions + "memory"
- `SOUL.md` - persona, boundaries, tone
- `TOOLS.md` - user-maintained tool notes (e.g. `imsg`, `sag`, conventions)
- `BOOTSTRAP.md` - one-time first-run ritual (deleted after completion)
- `IDENTITY.md` - agent name/vibe/emoji
- `USER.md` - user profile + preferred address

On the first turn of a new session, OpenClaw injects the contents of these files into the system prompt's Project Context.

Blank files are skipped. Large files are trimmed and truncated with a marker so prompts stay lean (read the file for full content).

If a file is missing, OpenClaw injects a single "missing file" marker line (and `openclaw setup` will create a safe default template).

`BOOTSTRAP.md` is only created for a **brand new workspace** (no other bootstrap files present). While it is pending, OpenClaw keeps it in Project Context and adds system-prompt bootstrap guidance for the initial ritual instead of copying it into the user message. If you delete it after completing the ritual, it should not be recreated on later restarts.

After a workspace has been observed, OpenClaw also keeps a state-dir attestation marker for the workspace path. If a recently attested workspace disappears or is wiped, startup refuses to silently re-seed `BOOTSTRAP.md`; restore the workspace or use a full onboard reset so the workspace and marker are cleared together.

To disable bootstrap file creation entirely (for pre-seeded workspaces), set:

```json5
{ agents: { defaults: { skipBootstrap: true } } }
```

## Built-in tools

Core tools (read/exec/edit/write and related system tools) are always available,
subject to tool policy. `apply_patch` is optional and gated by
`tools.exec.applyPatch`. `TOOLS.md` does **not** control which tools exist; it's
guidance for how _you_ want them used.

## Skills

OpenClaw loads skills from these locations (highest precedence first):

- Workspace: `<workspace>/skills`
- Project agent skills: `<workspace>/.agents/skills`
- Personal agent skills: `~/.agents/skills`
- Managed/local: `~/.openclaw/skills`
- Bundled (shipped with the install)
- Extra skill folders: `skills.load.extraDirs`

Skill roots can contain grouped folders such as
`<workspace>/skills/personal/foo/SKILL.md`; the skill is still exposed by its
flat frontmatter name, for example `foo`.

Skills can be gated by config/env (see `skills` in [Gateway configuration](/gateway/configuration)).

## Runtime boundaries

The embedded agent runtime is OpenClaw-owned: model discovery, tool wiring,
prompt assembly, session management, and channel delivery share one integrated
runtime surface.

## Sessions

Session transcripts are stored as JSONL at:

- `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/<SessionId>.jsonl`

The session ID is stable and chosen by OpenClaw.
Legacy session folders from other tools are not read.

## Steering while streaming

Inbound prompts that arrive mid-run are steered into the current run by default.
Steering is delivered **after the current assistant turn finishes executing its
tool calls**, before the next LLM call, and no longer skips remaining tool calls
from the current assistant message.

`/queue steer` is the default active-run behavior. `/queue followup` and
`/queue collect` make messages wait for a later turn instead of steering.
`/queue interrupt` aborts the active run instead. See [Queue](/concepts/queue)
and [Steering queue](/concepts/queue-steering) for queue and boundary behavior.

Block streaming sends completed assistant blocks as soon as they finish; it is
**off by default** (`agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault: "off"`).
Tune the boundary via `agents.defaults.blockStreamingBreak` (`text_end` vs `message_end`; defaults to text_end).
Control soft block chunking with `agents.defaults.blockStreamingChunk` (defaults to
800-1200 chars; prefers paragraph breaks, then newlines; sentences last).
Coalesce streamed chunks with `agents.defaults.blockStreamingCoalesce` to reduce
single-line spam (idle-based merging before send). Non-Telegram channels require
explicit `*.blockStreaming: true` to enable block replies.
Verbose tool summaries are emitted at tool start (no debounce); Control UI
streams tool output via agent events when available.
More details: [Streaming + chunking](/concepts/streaming).

## Model refs

Model refs in config (for example `agents.defaults.model` and `agents.defaults.models`) are parsed by splitting on the **first** `/`.

- Use `provider/model` when configuring models.
- If the model ID itself contains `/` (OpenRouter-style), include the provider prefix (example: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2`).
- If you omit the provider, OpenClaw tries an alias first, then a unique
  configured-provider match for that exact model id, and only then falls back
  to the configured default provider. If that provider no longer exposes the
  configured default model, OpenClaw falls back to the first configured
  provider/model instead of surfacing a stale removed-provider default.

## Configuration (minimal)

At minimum, set:

- `agents.defaults.workspace`
- `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` (strongly recommended)

# File write runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-fs-write
title: Runtime tool fixture — fs.write
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.fs.write
objective: Verify file write behavior is tracked across OpenClaw and Codex while Codex owns write natively.
successCriteria:
  - OpenClaw may expose OpenClaw write while Codex app-server mode may omit duplicate OpenClaw dynamic write.
  - Mock provider write plans are reported as fixture intent, not as actual runtime tool calls.
  - The row stays report-only until the fixture validates native Codex write behavior directly.

      action: split native write behavior from OpenClaw dynamic tool parity
      reason: Codex app-server intentionally owns write natively; the fixture must not require OpenClaw dynamic write exposure.
    knownHarnessGap:
      issue: "#80319"
      reason: QA tool-defaults currently needs native write behavior coverage instead of OpenClaw dynamic write exposure.

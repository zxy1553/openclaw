# Exec runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-exec
title: Runtime tool fixture — exec
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.exec
objective: Verify command execution behavior is tracked across OpenClaw and Codex while Codex owns exec/process natively.
successCriteria:
  - OpenClaw may expose OpenClaw exec while Codex app-server mode may omit duplicate OpenClaw dynamic exec/process.
  - Mock provider exec plans are reported as fixture intent, not as actual runtime tool calls.
  - The row stays report-only until the fixture validates native Codex command behavior directly.

      action: split native command behavior from OpenClaw dynamic tool parity
      reason: Codex app-server intentionally owns command execution natively; the fixture must not require OpenClaw dynamic exec exposure.
    knownHarnessGap:
      issue: "#80319"
      reason: QA tool-defaults currently needs native command behavior coverage instead of OpenClaw dynamic exec exposure.

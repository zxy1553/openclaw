GitHub Copilot is GitHub's AI coding assistant. It provides access to Copilot
models for your GitHub account and plan. OpenClaw can use Copilot as a model
provider or agent runtime in three different ways.

## Three ways to use Copilot in OpenClaw

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Built-in provider (github-copilot)">
    Use the native device-login flow to obtain a GitHub token, then exchange it for
    Copilot API tokens when OpenClaw runs. This is the **default** and simplest path
    because it does not require VS Code.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run the login command">
        ```bash
        openclaw models auth login-github-copilot
        ```

        You will be prompted to visit a URL and enter a one-time code. Keep the
        terminal open until it completes.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set a default model">
        ```bash
        openclaw models set github-copilot/claude-opus-4.7
        ```

        Or in config:

        ```json5
        {
          agents: {
            defaults: { model: { primary: "github-copilot/claude-opus-4.7" } },
          },
        }
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Copilot SDK harness plugin (copilot)">
    Install the external `@openclaw/copilot` plugin when you want GitHub's
    Copilot CLI and SDK to own the low-level agent loop for selected
    `github-copilot/*` models.

    ```bash
    openclaw plugins install clawhub:@openclaw/copilot
    ```

    Then opt a model or provider into the runtime:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          model: "github-copilot/gpt-5.5",
          models: {
            "github-copilot/gpt-5.5": {
              agentRuntime: { id: "copilot" },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    Choose this when you want native Copilot CLI sessions, SDK-managed thread
    state, and Copilot-owned compaction for those agent turns. See
    [Copilot SDK harness](/plugins/copilot) for the full runtime contract.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Copilot Proxy plugin (copilot-proxy)">
    Use the **Copilot Proxy** VS Code extension as a local bridge. OpenClaw talks to
    the proxy's `/v1` endpoint and uses the model list you configure there.

    <Note>
    Choose this when you already run Copilot Proxy in VS Code or need to route
    through it. You must enable the plugin and keep the VS Code extension running.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Optional flags

| Flag            | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--yes`         | Skip the confirmation prompt                        |
| `--set-default` | Also apply the provider's recommended default model |

```bash
# Skip confirmation
openclaw models auth login-github-copilot --yes

# Login and set the default model in one step
openclaw models auth login --provider github-copilot --method device --set-default
```

## Non-interactive onboarding

If you already have a GitHub OAuth access token for Copilot, import it during
headless setup with `openclaw onboard --non-interactive`:

```bash
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --accept-risk \
  --auth-choice github-copilot \
  --github-copilot-token "$COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  --skip-channels --skip-health
```

You can also omit `--auth-choice`; passing `--github-copilot-token` infers the
GitHub Copilot provider auth choice. If the flag is omitted, onboarding falls
back to `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Use
`--secret-input-mode ref` with `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` set to store an env-backed
`tokenRef` instead of plaintext in `auth-profiles.json`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Interactive TTY required">
    The device-login flow requires an interactive TTY. Run it directly in a
    terminal, not in a non-interactive script or CI pipeline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model availability depends on your plan">
    Copilot model availability depends on your GitHub plan. If a model is
    rejected, try another ID (for example `github-copilot/gpt-5.5`). See
    GitHub's [supported models per Copilot plan](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models#supported-ai-models-per-copilot-plan)
    for the current model list.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Live catalog refresh from the Copilot API">
    Once the device-login (or env-var) auth path has resolved a GitHub token,
    OpenClaw refreshes the model catalog on demand from `${baseUrl}/models`
    (the same endpoint VS Code Copilot uses) so the runtime tracks
    per-account entitlement and accurate context windows without manifest
    churn. Newly published Copilot models become visible without an OpenClaw
    upgrade, and context windows reflect the real per-model limits
    (e.g. 400k for the gpt-5.x series, 1M for the internal
    `claude-opus-*-1m` variants).

    The bundled static catalog stays as the visible fallback when discovery
    is disabled, the user has no GitHub auth profile, the token-exchange
    fails, or the `/models` HTTPS call errors. To opt out and rely entirely
    on the static manifest catalog (offline / air-gapped scenarios):

    ```json5
    {
      plugins: {
        entries: {
          "github-copilot": {
            config: { discovery: { enabled: false } },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transport selection">
    Claude model IDs use the Anthropic Messages transport automatically. GPT,
    o-series, and Gemini models keep the OpenAI Responses transport. OpenClaw
    selects the correct transport based on the model ref.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request compatibility">
    OpenClaw sends Copilot IDE-style request headers on Copilot transports,
    including built-in compaction, tool-result, and image follow-up turns. It
    does not enable provider-level Responses continuation for Copilot unless
    that behavior has been verified against Copilot's API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment variable resolution order">
    OpenClaw resolves Copilot auth from environment variables in the following
    priority order:

    | Priority | Variable              | Notes                            |
    | -------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
    | 1        | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` | Highest priority, Copilot-specific |
    | 2        | `GH_TOKEN`            | GitHub CLI token (fallback)      |
    | 3        | `GITHUB_TOKEN`        | Standard GitHub token (lowest)   |

    When multiple variables are set, OpenClaw uses the highest-priority one.
    The device-login flow (`openclaw models auth login-github-copilot`) stores
    its token in the auth profile store and takes precedence over all environment
    variables.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token storage">
    The login stores a GitHub token in the auth profile store and exchanges it
    for a Copilot API token when OpenClaw runs. You do not need to manage the
    token manually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
The device-login command requires an interactive TTY. Use non-interactive
onboarding when you need headless setup.
</Warning>

## Memory search embeddings

GitHub Copilot can also serve as an embedding provider for
[memory search](/concepts/memory-search). If you have a Copilot subscription and
have logged in, OpenClaw can use it for embeddings without a separate API key.

### Config

Set `memorySearch.provider` explicitly to use GitHub Copilot embeddings. If a
GitHub token is available, OpenClaw discovers available embedding models from
the Copilot API and picks the best one automatically.

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      memorySearch: {
        provider: "github-copilot",
        // Optional: override the auto-discovered model
        model: "text-embedding-3-small",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### How it works

1. OpenClaw resolves your GitHub token (from env vars or auth profile).
2. Exchanges it for a short-lived Copilot API token.
3. Queries the Copilot `/models` endpoint to discover available embedding models.
4. Picks the best model (prefers `text-embedding-3-small`).
5. Sends embedding requests to the Copilot `/embeddings` endpoint.

Model availability depends on your GitHub plan. If no embedding models are
available, OpenClaw skips Copilot and tries the next provider.

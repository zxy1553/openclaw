Sub-agents are background agent runs spawned from an existing agent run.
They run in their own session (`agent:<agentId>:subagent:<uuid>`) and,
when finished, **announce** their result back to the requester chat
channel. Each sub-agent run is tracked as a
[background task](/automation/tasks).

Primary goals:

- Parallelize "research / long task / slow tool" work without blocking the main run.
- Keep sub-agents isolated by default (session separation + optional sandboxing).
- Keep the tool surface hard to misuse: sub-agents do **not** get session tools by default.
- Support configurable nesting depth for orchestrator patterns.

<Note>
**Cost note:** each sub-agent has its own context and token usage by
default. For heavy or repetitive tasks, set a cheaper model for sub-agents
and keep your main agent on a higher-quality model. Configure via
`agents.defaults.subagents.model` or per-agent overrides. When a child
    genuinely needs the requester's current transcript, the agent can request
    `context: "fork"` on that one spawn. Thread-bound subagent sessions default
    to `context: "fork"` because they branch the current conversation into a
    follow-up thread.
</Note>

## Slash command

Use `/subagents` to inspect sub-agent runs for the **current session**:

```text
/subagents list
/subagents log <id|#> [limit] [tools]
/subagents info <id|#>
```

`/subagents info` shows run metadata (status, timestamps, session id,
transcript path, cleanup). Use `sessions_history` for a bounded,
safety-filtered recall view; inspect the transcript path on disk when you
need the raw full transcript.

### Thread binding controls

These commands work on channels that support persistent thread bindings.
See [Thread supporting channels](#thread-supporting-channels) below.

```text
/focus <subagent-label|session-key|session-id|session-label>
/unfocus
/agents
/session idle <duration|off>
/session max-age <duration|off>
```

### Spawn behavior

Agents start background sub-agents with `sessions_spawn`. Sub-agent completions
return as internal parent-session events; the parent/requester agent decides
whether a user-facing update is needed.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Non-blocking, push-based completion">
    - `sessions_spawn` is non-blocking; it returns a run id immediately.
    - On completion, the sub-agent reports back to the parent/requester session.
    - Agent turns that need child results should call `sessions_yield` after spawning required work. That ends the current turn and lets completion events arrive as the next model-visible message.
    - Completion is push-based. Once spawned, do **not** poll `/subagents list`, `sessions_list`, or `sessions_history` in a loop just to wait for it to finish; inspect status only on-demand for debugging visibility.
    - Child output is a report/evidence for the requester agent to synthesize. It is not user-authored instruction text and cannot override system, developer, or user policy.
    - On completion, OpenClaw best-effort closes tracked browser tabs/processes opened by that sub-agent session before the announce cleanup flow continues.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Completion delivery">
    - OpenClaw hands completions back to the requester session through an `agent` turn with a stable idempotency key.
    - If the requester run is still active, OpenClaw first tries to wake/steer that run instead of starting a second visible reply path.
    - If an active requester cannot be woken, OpenClaw falls back to a requester-agent handoff with the same completion context instead of dropping the announce.
    - A successful parent handoff completes sub-agent delivery even when the parent decides no visible user update is needed.
    - Native sub-agents do not get the message tool. They return plain assistant text to the parent/requester agent; human-visible replies are owned by the parent/requester agent's normal delivery policy.
    - If direct handoff cannot be used, it falls back to queue routing.
    - If queue routing is still not available, the announce is retried with a short exponential backoff before final give-up.
    - Completion delivery keeps the resolved requester route: thread-bound or conversation-bound completion routes win when available; if the completion origin only provides a channel, OpenClaw fills the missing target/account from the requester session's resolved route (`lastChannel` / `lastTo` / `lastAccountId`) so direct delivery still works.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Completion handoff metadata">
    The completion handoff to the requester session is runtime-generated
    internal context (not user-authored text) and includes:

    - `Result` — the latest visible `assistant` reply text from the child. Tool/toolResult output is not promoted into child results. Terminal failed runs do not reuse captured reply text.
    - `Status` — `completed; ready for parent review` / `failed` / `timed out` / `unknown`.
    - Compact runtime/token stats.
    - A review instruction telling the requester agent to verify the result before deciding whether the original task is done.
    - Follow-up guidance telling the requester agent to continue the task or record a follow-up when the child result leaves more action.
    - A final-update instruction for the no-more-action path, written in normal assistant voice without forwarding raw internal metadata.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Modes and ACP runtime">
    - `--model` and `--thinking` override defaults for that specific run.
    - Use `info`/`log` to inspect details and output after completion.
    - For persistent thread-bound sessions, use `sessions_spawn` with `thread: true` and `mode: "session"`.
    - If the requester channel does not support thread bindings, use `mode: "run"` instead of retrying impossible thread-bound combinations.
    - For ACP harness sessions (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, or explicit Codex ACP/acpx), use `sessions_spawn` with `runtime: "acp"` when the tool advertises that runtime. See [ACP delivery model](/tools/acp-agents#delivery-model) when debugging completions or agent-to-agent loops. When the `codex` plugin is enabled, Codex chat/thread control should prefer `/codex ...` over ACP unless the user explicitly asks for ACP/acpx.
    - OpenClaw hides `runtime: "acp"` until ACP is enabled, the requester is not sandboxed, and a backend plugin such as `acpx` is loaded. `runtime: "acp"` expects an external ACP harness id, or an `agents.list[]` entry with `runtime.type="acp"`; use the default sub-agent runtime for normal OpenClaw config agents from `agents_list`.

## Context modes

Native sub-agents start isolated unless the caller explicitly asks to fork
the current transcript.

| Mode       | When to use it                                                                                                                         | Behavior                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isolated` | Fresh research, independent implementation, slow tool work, or anything that can be briefed in the task text                           | Creates a clean child transcript. This is the default and keeps token use lower.  |
| `fork`     | Work that depends on the current conversation, prior tool results, or nuanced instructions already present in the requester transcript | Branches the requester transcript into the child session before the child starts. |

Use `fork` sparingly. It is for context-sensitive delegation, not a
replacement for writing a clear task prompt.

## Tool: `sessions_spawn`

Starts a sub-agent run with `deliver: false` on the global `subagent` lane,
then runs an announce step and posts the announce reply to the requester
chat channel.

Availability depends on the caller's effective tool policy. The `coding` and
`full` profiles expose `sessions_spawn` by default. The `messaging` profile
does not; add `tools.alsoAllow: ["sessions_spawn", "sessions_yield",
"subagents"]` or use `tools.profile: "coding"` for agents that should delegate
work. Channel/group, provider, sandbox, and per-agent allow/deny policies can
still remove the tool after the profile stage. Use `/tools` from the same
session to confirm the effective tool list.

**Defaults:**

- **Model:** native sub-agents inherit the caller unless you set `agents.defaults.subagents.model` (or per-agent `agents.list[].subagents.model`). ACP runtime spawns use the same configured subagent model when present; otherwise the ACP harness keeps its own default. An explicit `sessions_spawn.model` still wins.
- **Thinking:** native sub-agents inherit the caller unless you set `agents.defaults.subagents.thinking` (or per-agent `agents.list[].subagents.thinking`). ACP runtime spawns also apply `agents.defaults.models["provider/model"].params.thinking` for the selected model. An explicit `sessions_spawn.thinking` still wins.
- **Run timeout:** if `sessions_spawn.runTimeoutSeconds` is omitted, OpenClaw uses `agents.defaults.subagents.runTimeoutSeconds` when set; otherwise it falls back to `0` (no timeout).
- **Task delivery:** native sub-agents receive the delegated task in their first visible `[Subagent Task]` message. The sub-agent system prompt carries runtime rules and routing context, not a hidden duplicate of the task.

Accepted native sub-agent spawns include the resolved child model metadata in
the tool result: `resolvedModel` contains the applied model ref and
`resolvedProvider` contains the provider prefix when the ref has one.

### Delegation prompt mode

`agents.defaults.subagents.delegationMode` controls prompt guidance only; it does not change tool policy or enforce delegation.

- `suggest` (default): keep the standard prompt nudge to use sub-agents for larger or slower work.
- `prefer`: tell the main agent to stay responsive and delegate anything more involved than a direct reply through `sessions_spawn`.

Per-agent overrides use `agents.list[].subagents.delegationMode`.

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      subagents: {
        delegationMode: "prefer",
        maxConcurrent: 4,
      },
    },
    list: [
      {
        id: "coordinator",
        subagents: { delegationMode: "prefer" },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

</ParamField>

<Warning>
`sessions_spawn` does **not** accept channel-delivery params (`target`,
`channel`, `to`, `threadId`, `replyTo`, `transport`). Native sub-agents report
their latest assistant turn back to the requester; external delivery stays with
the parent/requester agent.
</Warning>

### Task names and targeting

`taskName` is a model-facing handle for orchestration, not a session key.
Use it for stable child names such as `review_subagents`,
`linux_validation`, or `docs_update` when a coordinator may need to inspect
that child later.

Target resolution accepts exact `taskName` matches and unambiguous
prefixes. Matching is scoped to the same active/recent target window used
by numbered `/subagents` targets, so a stale completed child does not make
a reused handle ambiguous. If two active or recent children share the same
`taskName`, the target is ambiguous; use the list index, session key, or
run id instead.

The reserved targets `last` and `all` are not valid `taskName` values
because they already have control meanings.

## Tool: `sessions_yield`

Ends the current model turn and waits for runtime events, primarily
sub-agent completion events, to arrive as the next message. Use it after
spawning required child work when the requester cannot produce a final
answer until those completions arrive.

`sessions_yield` is the waiting primitive. Do not replace it with polling
loops over `subagents`, `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, shell
`sleep`, or process polling just to detect child completion.

Only use `sessions_yield` when the session's effective tool list includes
it. Some minimal or custom tool profiles may expose `sessions_spawn` and
`subagents` without exposing `sessions_yield`; in that case, do not invent
a polling loop just to wait for completion.

When active children exist, OpenClaw injects a compact runtime-generated
`Active Subagents` prompt block into normal turns so the requester can see
the current child sessions, run ids, statuses, labels, tasks, and
`taskName` aliases without polling. The task and label fields in that
block are quoted as data, not instructions, because they can originate
from user/model-provided spawn arguments.

## Tool: `subagents`

Lists spawned sub-agent runs owned by the requester session. It is scoped
to the current requester; a child can only see its own controlled children.

Use `subagents` for on-demand status and debugging. Use `sessions_yield` to
wait for completion events.

## Thread-bound sessions

When thread bindings are enabled for a channel, a sub-agent can stay bound
to a thread so follow-up user messages in that thread keep routing to the
same sub-agent session.

### Thread supporting channels

Any channel with a session-binding adapter can support persistent
thread-bound subagent sessions (`sessions_spawn` with `thread: true`).
Bundled adapters currently include Discord threads, Matrix threads,
Telegram forum topics, and current-conversation bindings for Feishu.
Use the per-channel `threadBindings` config keys for enablement,
timeouts, and `spawnSessions`.

### Manual controls

| Command            | Effect                                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/focus <target>`  | Bind the current thread (or create one) to a sub-agent/session target |
| `/unfocus`         | Remove the binding for the current bound thread                       |
| `/agents`          | List active runs and binding state (`thread:<id>` or `unbound`)       |
| `/session idle`    | Inspect/update idle auto-unfocus (focused bound threads only)         |
| `/session max-age` | Inspect/update hard cap (focused bound threads only)                  |

### Config switches

- **Global default:** `session.threadBindings.enabled`, `session.threadBindings.idleHours`, `session.threadBindings.maxAgeHours`.
- **Channel override and spawn auto-bind keys** are adapter-specific. See [Thread supporting channels](#thread-supporting-channels) above.

See [Configuration reference](/gateway/configuration-reference) and
[Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands) for current adapter details.

### Allowlist

<ParamField path="agents.list[].subagents.allowAgents" type="string[]">
  List of configured agent ids that can be targeted via explicit `agentId` (`["*"]` allows any configured target). Default: only the requester agent. If you set a list and still want the requester to spawn itself with `agentId`, include the requester id in the list.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="agents.defaults.subagents.allowAgents" type="string[]">
  Default configured target-agent allowlist used when the requester agent does not set its own `subagents.allowAgents`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="agents.defaults.subagents.requireAgentId" type="boolean" default="false">
  Block `sessions_spawn` calls that omit `agentId` (forces explicit profile selection). Per-agent override: `agents.list[].subagents.requireAgentId`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="agents.defaults.subagents.announceTimeoutMs" type="number" default="120000">
  Per-call timeout for gateway `agent` announce delivery attempts. Values are positive integer milliseconds and are clamped to the platform-safe timer maximum. Transient retries can make the total announce wait longer than one configured timeout.
</ParamField>

If the requester session is sandboxed, `sessions_spawn` rejects targets
that would run unsandboxed.

### Discovery

Use `agents_list` to see which agent ids are currently allowed for
`sessions_spawn`. The response includes each listed agent's effective
model and embedded runtime metadata so callers can distinguish OpenClaw, Codex
app-server, and other configured native runtimes.

`allowAgents` entries must point at configured agent ids in `agents.list[]`.
`["*"]` means any configured target agent plus the requester. If an agent config
is deleted but its id remains in `allowAgents`, `sessions_spawn` rejects that id
and `agents_list` omits it. Run `openclaw doctor --fix` to clean stale
allowlist entries, or add a minimal `agents.list[]` entry when the target should
remain spawnable while inheriting defaults.

### Auto-archive

- Sub-agent sessions are automatically archived after `agents.defaults.subagents.archiveAfterMinutes` (default `60`).
- Archive uses `sessions.delete` and renames the transcript to `*.deleted.<timestamp>` (same folder).
- `cleanup: "delete"` archives immediately after announce (still keeps the transcript via rename).
- Auto-archive is best-effort; pending timers are lost if the gateway restarts.
- `runTimeoutSeconds` does **not** auto-archive; it only stops the run. The session remains until auto-archive.
- Auto-archive applies equally to depth-1 and depth-2 sessions.
- Browser cleanup is separate from archive cleanup: tracked browser tabs/processes are best-effort closed when the run finishes, even if the transcript/session record is kept.

## Nested sub-agents

By default, sub-agents cannot spawn their own sub-agents
(`maxSpawnDepth: 1`). Set `maxSpawnDepth: 2` to enable one level of
nesting — the **orchestrator pattern**: main → orchestrator sub-agent →
worker sub-sub-agents.

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      subagents: {
        maxSpawnDepth: 2, // allow sub-agents to spawn children (default: 1)
        maxChildrenPerAgent: 5, // max active children per agent session (default: 5)
        maxConcurrent: 8, // global concurrency lane cap (default: 8)
        runTimeoutSeconds: 900, // default timeout for sessions_spawn when omitted (0 = no timeout)
        announceTimeoutMs: 120000, // per-call gateway announce timeout
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Depth levels

| Depth | Session key shape                            | Role                                          | Can spawn?                   |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0     | `agent:<id>:main`                            | Main agent                                    | Always                       |
| 1     | `agent:<id>:subagent:<uuid>`                 | Sub-agent (orchestrator when depth 2 allowed) | Only if `maxSpawnDepth >= 2` |
| 2     | `agent:<id>:subagent:<uuid>:subagent:<uuid>` | Sub-sub-agent (leaf worker)                   | Never                        |

### Announce chain

Results flow back up the chain:

1. Depth-2 worker finishes → announces to its parent (depth-1 orchestrator).
2. Depth-1 orchestrator receives the announce, synthesizes results, finishes → announces to main.
3. Main agent receives the announce and delivers to the user.

Each level only sees announces from its direct children.

<Note>
**Operational guidance:** start child work once and wait for completion
events instead of building poll loops around `sessions_list`,
`sessions_history`, `/subagents list`, or `exec` sleep commands.
`sessions_list` and `/subagents list` keep child-session relationships
focused on live work — live children remain attached, ended children stay
visible for a short recent window, and stale store-only child links are
ignored after their freshness window. This prevents old `spawnedBy` /
`parentSessionKey` metadata from resurrecting ghost children after
restart. If a child completion event arrives after you already sent the
final answer, the correct follow-up is the exact silent token
`NO_REPLY` / `no_reply`.
</Note>

### Tool policy by depth

- Role and control scope are written into session metadata at spawn time. That keeps flat or restored session keys from accidentally regaining orchestrator privileges.
- **Depth 1 (orchestrator, when `maxSpawnDepth >= 2`):** gets `sessions_spawn`, `subagents`, `sessions_list`, `sessions_history` so it can spawn children and inspect their status. Other session/system tools remain denied.
- **Depth 1 (leaf, when `maxSpawnDepth == 1`):** no session tools (current default behavior).
- **Depth 2 (leaf worker):** no session tools — `sessions_spawn` is always denied at depth 2. Cannot spawn further children.

### Per-agent spawn limit

Each agent session (at any depth) can have at most `maxChildrenPerAgent`
(default `5`) active children at a time. This prevents runaway fan-out
from a single orchestrator.

### Cascade stop

Stopping a depth-1 orchestrator automatically stops all its depth-2
children:

- `/stop` in the main chat stops all depth-1 agents and cascades to their depth-2 children.

## Authentication

Sub-agent auth is resolved by **agent id**, not by session type:

- The sub-agent session key is `agent:<agentId>:subagent:<uuid>`.
- The auth store is loaded from that agent's `agentDir`.
- The main agent's auth profiles are merged in as a **fallback**; agent profiles override main profiles on conflicts.

The merge is additive, so main profiles are always available as
fallbacks. Fully isolated auth per agent is not supported yet.

## Announce

Sub-agents report back via an announce step:

- The announce step runs inside the sub-agent session (not the requester session).
- If the sub-agent replies exactly `ANNOUNCE_SKIP`, nothing is posted.
- If the latest assistant text is the exact silent token `NO_REPLY` / `no_reply`, announce output is suppressed even if earlier visible progress existed.

Delivery depends on requester depth:

- Top-level requester sessions use a follow-up `agent` call with external delivery (`deliver=true`).
- Nested requester subagent sessions receive an internal follow-up injection (`deliver=false`) so the orchestrator can synthesize child results in-session.
- If a nested requester subagent session is gone, OpenClaw falls back to that session's requester when available.

For top-level requester sessions, completion-mode direct delivery first
resolves any bound conversation/thread route and hook override, then fills
missing channel-target fields from the requester session's stored route.
That keeps completions on the right chat/topic even when the completion
origin only identifies the channel.

Child completion aggregation is scoped to the current requester run when
building nested completion findings, preventing stale prior-run child
outputs from leaking into the current announce. Announce replies preserve
thread/topic routing when available on channel adapters.

### Announce context

Announce context is normalized to a stable internal event block:

| Field          | Source                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source         | `subagent` or `cron`                                                                                          |
| Session ids    | Child session key/id                                                                                          |
| Type           | Announce type + task label                                                                                    |
| Status         | Derived from runtime outcome (`success`, `error`, `timeout`, or `unknown`) — **not** inferred from model text |
| Result content | Latest visible assistant text from the child                                                                  |

Terminal failed runs report failure status without replaying captured
reply text. Tool/toolResult output is not promoted into child result text.

### Stats line

Announce payloads include a stats line at the end (even when wrapped):

- Runtime (e.g. `runtime 5m12s`).
- Token usage (input/output/total).
- Estimated cost when model pricing is configured (`models.providers.*.models[].cost`).
- `sessionKey`, `sessionId`, and transcript path so the main agent can fetch history via `sessions_history` or inspect the file on disk.

Internal metadata is meant for orchestration only; user-facing replies
should be rewritten in normal assistant voice.

### Why prefer `sessions_history`

`sessions_history` is the safer orchestration path:

- Assistant recall is normalized first: thinking tags stripped; `<relevant-memories>` / `<relevant_memories>` scaffolding stripped; plain-text tool-call XML payload blocks (`<tool_call>`, `<function_call>`, `<tool_calls>`, `<function_calls>`) stripped, including truncated payloads that never close cleanly; downgraded tool-call/result scaffolding and historical-context markers stripped; leaked model control tokens (`<|assistant|>`, other ASCII `<|...|>`, full-width `<｜...｜>`) stripped; malformed MiniMax tool-call XML stripped.
- Credential/token-like text is redacted.
- Long blocks can be truncated.
- Very large histories can drop older rows or replace an oversized row with `[sessions_history omitted: message too large]`.
- Raw on-disk transcript inspection is the fallback when you need the full byte-for-byte transcript.

## Tool policy

Sub-agents use the same profile and tool-policy pipeline as the parent or
target agent first. After that, OpenClaw applies the sub-agent restriction
layer.

With no restrictive `tools.profile`, sub-agents get **all tools except the
message tool, session tools, and system tools**:

- `sessions_list`
- `sessions_history`
- `sessions_send`
- `sessions_spawn`
- `message`

`sessions_history` remains a bounded, sanitized recall view here too — it
is not a raw transcript dump.

When `maxSpawnDepth >= 2`, depth-1 orchestrator sub-agents additionally
receive `sessions_spawn`, `subagents`, `sessions_list`, and
`sessions_history` so they can manage their children.

### Override via config

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      subagents: {
        maxConcurrent: 1,
      },
    },
  },
  tools: {
    subagents: {
      tools: {
        // deny wins
        deny: ["gateway", "cron"],
        // if allow is set, it becomes allow-only (deny still wins)
        // allow: ["read", "exec", "process"]
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`tools.subagents.tools.allow` is a final allow-only filter. It can narrow
the already-resolved tool set, but it cannot **add back** a tool removed
by `tools.profile`. For example, `tools.profile: "coding"` includes
`web_search`/`web_fetch` but not the `browser` tool. To let
coding-profile sub-agents use browser automation, add browser at the
profile stage:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    profile: "coding",
    alsoAllow: ["browser"],
  },
}
```

Use per-agent `agents.list[].tools.alsoAllow: ["browser"]` when only one
agent should get browser automation.

## Concurrency

Sub-agents use a dedicated in-process queue lane:

- **Lane name:** `subagent`
- **Concurrency:** `agents.defaults.subagents.maxConcurrent` (default `8`)

## Liveness and recovery

OpenClaw does not treat `endedAt` absence as permanent proof that a
sub-agent is still alive. Unended runs older than the stale-run window
stop counting as active/pending in `/subagents list`, status summaries,
descendant completion gating, and per-session concurrency checks.

After a gateway restart, stale unended restored runs are pruned unless
their child session is marked `abortedLastRun: true`. Those
restart-aborted child sessions remain recoverable through the sub-agent
orphan recovery flow, which sends a synthetic resume message before
clearing the aborted marker.

Automatic restart recovery is bounded per child session. If the same
sub-agent child is accepted for orphan recovery repeatedly inside the
rapid re-wedge window, OpenClaw persists a recovery tombstone on that
session and stops auto-resuming it on later restarts. Run
`openclaw tasks maintenance --apply` to reconcile the task record, or
`openclaw doctor --fix` to clear stale aborted recovery flags on
tombstoned sessions.

<Note>
If a sub-agent spawn fails with Gateway `PAIRING_REQUIRED` /
`scope-upgrade`, check the RPC caller before editing pairing state.
Internal `sessions_spawn` coordination should connect as
`client.id: "gateway-client"` with `client.mode: "backend"` over direct
loopback shared-token/password auth; that path does not depend on the
CLI's paired-device scope baseline. Remote callers, explicit
`deviceIdentity`, explicit device-token paths, and browser/node clients
still need normal device approval for scope upgrades.
</Note>

## Stopping

- Sending `/stop` in the requester chat aborts the requester session and stops any active sub-agent runs spawned from it, cascading to nested children.

## Limitations

- Sub-agent announce is **best-effort**. If the gateway restarts, pending "announce back" work is lost.
- Sub-agents still share the same gateway process resources; treat `maxConcurrent` as a safety valve.
- `sessions_spawn` is always non-blocking: it returns `{ status: "accepted", runId, childSessionKey }` immediately.
- Sub-agent context only injects `AGENTS.md` and `TOOLS.md` (no `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, or `BOOTSTRAP.md`). Codex-native subagents follow the same boundary: `TOOLS.md` stays in inherited Codex thread instructions, while parent-only persona, identity, and user files are injected as turn-scoped collaboration instructions so children do not clone them.
- Maximum nesting depth is 5 (`maxSpawnDepth` range: 1–5). Depth 2 is recommended for most use cases.
- `maxChildrenPerAgent` caps active children per session (default `5`, range `1–20`).

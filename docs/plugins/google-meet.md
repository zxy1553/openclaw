summary: "Google Meet plugin: join explicit Meet URLs through Chrome or Twilio with agent talk-back defaults"
read_when:
  - You want an OpenClaw agent to join a Google Meet call
  - You want an OpenClaw agent to create a new Google Meet call
  - You are configuring Chrome, Chrome node, or Twilio as a Google Meet transport
title: "Google Meet plugin"
---

Google Meet participant support for OpenClaw — the plugin is explicit by design:

- It only joins an explicit `https://meet.google.com/...` URL.
- It can create a new Meet space through the Google Meet API, then join the
  returned URL.
- `agent` is the default talk-back mode: realtime transcription listens, the
  configured OpenClaw agent answers, and regular OpenClaw TTS speaks into Meet.
- `bidi` remains available as the fallback direct realtime voice model mode.
- Agents choose the join behavior with `mode`: use `agent` for live
  listen/talk-back, `bidi` for direct realtime voice fallback, or `transcribe`
  to join/control the browser without the talk-back bridge.
- Auth starts as personal Google OAuth or an already signed-in Chrome profile.
- There is no automatic consent announcement.
- The default Chrome audio backend is `BlackHole 2ch`.
- Chrome can run locally or on a paired node host.
- Twilio accepts a dial-in number plus optional PIN or DTMF sequence; it
  cannot dial a Meet URL directly.
- The CLI command is `googlemeet`; `meet` is reserved for broader agent
  teleconference workflows.

## Quick start

Install the local audio dependencies and configure a realtime transcription
provider plus regular OpenClaw TTS. OpenAI is the default transcription
provider; Google Gemini Live also works as a separate `bidi` voice fallback with
`realtime.voiceProvider: "google"`:

```bash
brew install blackhole-2ch sox
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# only needed when realtime.voiceProvider is "google" for bidi mode
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

`blackhole-2ch` installs the `BlackHole 2ch` virtual audio device. Homebrew's
installer requires a reboot before macOS exposes the device:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, verify both pieces:

```bash
system_profiler SPAudioDataType | grep -i BlackHole
command -v sox
```

Enable the plugin:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "google-meet": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {},
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Check setup:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup
```

The setup output is meant to be agent-readable and mode-aware. It reports Chrome
profile, node pinning, and, for realtime Chrome joins, the BlackHole/SoX audio
bridge and delayed realtime intro checks. For observe-only joins, check the same
transport with `--mode transcribe`; that mode skips realtime audio prerequisites
because it does not listen through or speak through the bridge:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup --transport chrome-node --mode transcribe
```

When Twilio delegation is configured, setup also reports whether the
`voice-call` plugin, Twilio credentials, and public webhook exposure are ready.
Treat any `ok: false` check as a blocker for the checked transport and mode
before asking an agent to join. Use `openclaw googlemeet setup --json` for
scripts or machine-readable output. Use `--transport chrome`,
`--transport chrome-node`, or `--transport twilio` to preflight a specific
transport before an agent tries it.

For Twilio, always preflight the transport explicitly when the default transport
is Chrome:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup --transport twilio
```

That catches missing `voice-call` wiring, Twilio credentials, or unreachable
webhook exposure before the agent tries to dial the meeting.

Join a meeting:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

Or let an agent join through the `google_meet` tool:

```json
{
  "action": "join",
  "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "transport": "chrome-node",
  "mode": "agent"
}
```

The agent-facing `google_meet` tool stays available on non-macOS hosts for
artifact, calendar, setup, transcribe, Twilio, and `chrome-node` flows. Local
Chrome talk-back actions are blocked there because the bundled Chrome audio path
currently depends on macOS `BlackHole 2ch`. On Linux, use `mode: "transcribe"`,
Twilio dial-in, or a macOS `chrome-node` host for Chrome talk-back
participation.

Create a new meeting and join it:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet create --transport chrome-node --mode agent
```

For API-created rooms, use Google Meet `SpaceConfig.accessType` when you want
the room's no-knock policy to be explicit instead of inherited from the Google
account defaults:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet create --access-type OPEN --transport chrome-node --mode agent
```

`OPEN` lets anyone with the Meet URL join without knocking. `TRUSTED` lets the
host organization's trusted users, invited external users, and dial-in users
join without knocking. `RESTRICTED` limits no-knock entry to invitees. These
settings only apply to the official Google Meet API creation path, so OAuth
credentials must be configured.

If you authenticated Google Meet before this option was available, rerun
`openclaw googlemeet auth login --json` after adding the
`meetings.space.settings` scope to your Google OAuth consent screen.

Create only the URL without joining:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet create --no-join
```

`googlemeet create` has two paths:

- API create: used when Google Meet OAuth credentials are configured. This is
  the most deterministic path and does not depend on browser UI state.
- Browser fallback: used when OAuth credentials are absent. OpenClaw uses the
  pinned Chrome node, opens `https://meet.google.com/new`, waits for Google to
  redirect to a real meeting-code URL, then returns that URL. This path requires
  the OpenClaw Chrome profile on the node to already be signed in to Google.
  Browser automation handles Meet's own first-run microphone prompt; that prompt
  is not treated as a Google login failure.
  Join and create flows also try to reuse an existing Meet tab before opening a
  new one. Matching ignores harmless URL query strings such as `authuser`, so an
  agent retry should focus the already-open meeting instead of creating a second
  Chrome tab.

The command/tool output includes a `source` field (`api` or `browser`) so agents
can explain which path was used. `create` joins the new meeting by default and
returns `joined: true` plus the join session. To only mint the URL, use
`create --no-join` on the CLI or pass `"join": false` to the tool.

Or tell an agent: "Create a Google Meet, join it with the agent talk-back mode,
and send me the link." The agent should call `google_meet` with
`action: "create"` and then share the returned `meetingUri`.

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "transport": "chrome-node",
  "mode": "agent"
}
```

For an observe-only/browser-control join, set `"mode": "transcribe"`. That does
not start the duplex realtime voice bridge, does not require BlackHole or SoX,
and will not talk back into the meeting. Chrome joins in this mode also avoid
OpenClaw's microphone/camera permission grant and avoid the Meet **Use
microphone** path. If Meet shows an audio-choice interstitial, automation tries
the no-microphone path and otherwise reports a manual action instead of opening
the local microphone. In transcribe mode, managed Chrome transports also install
a best-effort Meet caption observer. `googlemeet status --json` and
`googlemeet doctor` surface `captioning`, `captionsEnabledAttempted`,
`transcriptLines`, `lastCaptionAt`, `lastCaptionSpeaker`, `lastCaptionText`,
and a short `recentTranscript` tail so operators can tell whether the browser
joined the call and whether Meet captions are producing text.
Use `openclaw googlemeet test-listen <meet-url> --transport chrome-node` when
you need a yes/no probe: it joins in transcribe mode, waits for fresh caption or
transcript movement, and returns `listenVerified`, `listenTimedOut`, manual
action fields, and the latest caption health.

During realtime sessions, `google_meet` status includes browser and audio bridge
health such as `inCall`, `manualActionRequired`, `providerConnected`,
`realtimeReady`, `audioInputActive`, `audioOutputActive`, last input/output
timestamps, byte counters, and bridge closed state. If a safe Meet page prompt
appears, browser automation handles it when it can. Login, host admission, and
browser/OS permission prompts are reported as manual action with a reason and
message for the agent to relay. Managed Chrome sessions only emit the intro or
test phrase after browser health reports `inCall: true`; otherwise status reports
`speechReady: false` and the speech attempt is blocked instead of pretending the
agent spoke into the meeting.

Local Chrome joins through the signed-in OpenClaw browser profile. Realtime mode
requires `BlackHole 2ch` for the microphone/speaker path used by OpenClaw. For
clean duplex audio, use separate virtual devices or a Loopback-style graph; a
single BlackHole device is enough for a first smoke test but can echo.

### Local gateway + Parallels Chrome

You do **not** need a full OpenClaw Gateway or model API key inside a macOS VM
just to make the VM own Chrome. Run the Gateway and agent locally, then run a
node host in the VM. Enable the bundled plugin on the VM once so the node
advertises the Chrome command:

What runs where:

- Gateway host: OpenClaw Gateway, agent workspace, model/API keys, realtime
  provider, and the Google Meet plugin config.
- Parallels macOS VM: OpenClaw CLI/node host, Google Chrome, SoX, BlackHole 2ch,
  and a Chrome profile signed in to Google.
- Not needed in the VM: Gateway service, agent config, OpenAI/GPT key, or model
  provider setup.

Install the VM dependencies:

```bash
brew install blackhole-2ch sox
```

Reboot the VM after installing BlackHole so macOS exposes `BlackHole 2ch`:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, verify the VM can see the audio device and SoX commands:

```bash
system_profiler SPAudioDataType | grep -i BlackHole
command -v sox
```

Install or update OpenClaw in the VM, then enable the bundled plugin there:

```bash
openclaw plugins enable google-meet
```

Start the node host in the VM:

```bash
openclaw node run --host <gateway-host> --port 18789 --display-name parallels-macos
```

If `<gateway-host>` is a LAN IP and you are not using TLS, the node refuses the
plaintext WebSocket unless you opt in for that trusted private network:

```bash
OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1 \
  openclaw node run --host <gateway-lan-ip> --port 18789 --display-name parallels-macos
```

Use the same environment variable when installing the node as a LaunchAgent:

```bash
OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1 \
  openclaw node install --host <gateway-lan-ip> --port 18789 --display-name parallels-macos --force
openclaw node restart
```

`OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1` is process environment, not an
`openclaw.json` setting. `openclaw node install` stores it in the LaunchAgent
environment when it is present on the install command.

Approve the node from the Gateway host:

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
```

Confirm the Gateway sees the node and that it advertises both `googlemeet.chrome`
and browser capability/`browser.proxy`:

```bash
openclaw nodes status
```

Route Meet through that node on the Gateway host:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    nodes: {
      allowCommands: ["googlemeet.chrome", "browser.proxy"],
    },
  },
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "google-meet": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          defaultTransport: "chrome-node",
          chrome: {
            guestName: "OpenClaw Agent",
            autoJoin: true,
            reuseExistingTab: true,
          },
          chromeNode: {
            node: "parallels-macos",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Now join normally from the Gateway host:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

or ask the agent to use the `google_meet` tool with `transport: "chrome-node"`.

For a one-command smoke test that creates or reuses a session, speaks a known
phrase, and prints session health:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet test-speech https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

During realtime join, OpenClaw browser automation fills the guest name, clicks
Join/Ask to join, and accepts Meet's first-run "Use microphone" choice when that
prompt appears. During observe-only join or browser-only meeting creation, it
continues past the same prompt without microphone when that choice is available.
If the browser profile is not signed in, Meet is waiting for host admission,
Chrome needs microphone/camera permission for a realtime join, or Meet is stuck
on a prompt automation could not resolve, the join/test-speech result reports
`manualActionRequired: true` with `manualActionReason` and
`manualActionMessage`. Agents should stop retrying the join, report that exact
message plus the current `browserUrl`/`browserTitle`, and retry only after the
manual browser action is complete.

If `chromeNode.node` is omitted, OpenClaw auto-selects only when exactly one
connected node advertises both `googlemeet.chrome` and browser control. If
several capable nodes are connected, set `chromeNode.node` to the node id,
display name, or remote IP.

Common failure checks:

- `Configured Google Meet node ... is not usable: offline`: the pinned node is
  known to the Gateway but unavailable. Agents should treat that node as
  diagnostic state, not as a usable Chrome host, and report the setup blocker
  instead of falling back to another transport unless the user asked for that.
- `No connected Google Meet-capable node`: start `openclaw node run` in the VM,
  approve pairing, and make sure `openclaw plugins enable google-meet` and
  `openclaw plugins enable browser` were run in the VM. Also confirm the
  Gateway host allows both node commands with
  `gateway.nodes.allowCommands: ["googlemeet.chrome", "browser.proxy"]`.
- `BlackHole 2ch audio device not found`: install `blackhole-2ch` on the host
  being checked and reboot before using local Chrome audio.
- `BlackHole 2ch audio device not found on the node`: install `blackhole-2ch`
  in the VM and reboot the VM.
- Chrome opens but cannot join: sign in to the browser profile inside the VM, or
  keep `chrome.guestName` set for guest join. Guest auto-join uses OpenClaw
  browser automation through the node browser proxy; make sure the node browser
  config points at the profile you want, for example
  `browser.defaultProfile: "user"` or a named existing-session profile.
- Duplicate Meet tabs: leave `chrome.reuseExistingTab: true` enabled. OpenClaw
  activates an existing tab for the same Meet URL before opening a new one, and
  browser meeting creation reuses an in-progress `https://meet.google.com/new`
  or Google account prompt tab before opening another one.
- No audio: in Meet, route microphone/speaker through the virtual audio device
  path used by OpenClaw; use separate virtual devices or Loopback-style routing
  for clean duplex audio.

## Install notes

The Chrome talk-back default uses two external tools:

- `sox`: command-line audio utility. The plugin uses explicit CoreAudio
  device commands for the default 24 kHz PCM16 audio bridge.
- `blackhole-2ch`: macOS virtual audio driver. It creates the `BlackHole 2ch`
  audio device that Chrome/Meet can route through.

OpenClaw does not bundle or redistribute either package. The docs ask users to
install them as host dependencies through Homebrew. SoX is licensed as
`LGPL-2.0-only AND GPL-2.0-only`; BlackHole is GPL-3.0. If you build an
installer or appliance that bundles BlackHole with OpenClaw, review BlackHole's
upstream licensing terms or get a separate license from Existential Audio.

## Transports

### Chrome

Chrome transport opens the Meet URL through OpenClaw browser control and joins
as the signed-in OpenClaw browser profile. On macOS, the plugin checks for
`BlackHole 2ch` before launch. If configured, it also runs an audio bridge
health command and startup command before opening Chrome. Use `chrome` when
Chrome/audio live on the Gateway host; use `chrome-node` when Chrome/audio live
on a paired node such as a Parallels macOS VM. For local Chrome, choose the
profile with `browser.defaultProfile`; `chrome.browserProfile` is passed to
`chrome-node` hosts.

```bash
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij --transport chrome
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij --transport chrome-node
```

Route Chrome microphone and speaker audio through the local OpenClaw audio
bridge. If `BlackHole 2ch` is not installed, the join fails with a setup error
instead of silently joining without an audio path.

### Twilio

Twilio transport is a strict dial plan delegated to the Voice Call plugin. It
does not parse Meet pages for phone numbers.

Use this when Chrome participation is not available or you want a phone dial-in
fallback. Google Meet must expose a phone dial-in number and PIN for the
meeting; OpenClaw does not discover those from the Meet page.

Enable the Voice Call plugin on the Gateway host, not on the Chrome node:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    allow: ["google-meet", "voice-call", "google"],
    entries: {
      "google-meet": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          defaultTransport: "chrome-node",
          // or set "twilio" if Twilio should be the default
        },
      },
      "voice-call": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          provider: "twilio",
          inboundPolicy: "allowlist",
          realtime: {
            enabled: true,
            provider: "google",
            instructions: "Join this Google Meet as an OpenClaw agent. Be brief.",
            toolPolicy: "safe-read-only",
            providers: {
              google: {
                silenceDurationMs: 500,
                startSensitivity: "high",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
      google: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Provide Twilio credentials through environment or config. Environment keeps
secrets out of `openclaw.json`:

```bash
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
export TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+15550001234
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

Use `realtime.provider: "openai"` with the OpenAI provider plugin and
`OPENAI_API_KEY` instead if that is your realtime voice provider.

Restart or reload the Gateway after enabling `voice-call`; plugin config changes
do not appear in an already running Gateway process until it reloads.

Then verify:

```bash
openclaw config validate
openclaw plugins list | grep -E 'google-meet|voice-call'
openclaw googlemeet setup
```

When Twilio delegation is wired, `googlemeet setup` includes successful
`twilio-voice-call-plugin`, `twilio-voice-call-credentials`, and
`twilio-voice-call-webhook` checks.

```bash
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij \
  --transport twilio \
  --dial-in-number +15551234567 \
  --pin 123456
```

Use `--dtmf-sequence` when the meeting needs a custom sequence:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij \
  --transport twilio \
  --dial-in-number +15551234567 \
  --dtmf-sequence ww123456#
```

## OAuth and preflight

OAuth is optional for creating a Meet link because `googlemeet create` can fall
back to browser automation. Configure OAuth when you want official API create,
space resolution, or Meet Media API preflight checks.

Google Meet API access uses user OAuth: create a Google Cloud OAuth client,
request the required scopes, authorize a Google account, then store the
resulting refresh token in the Google Meet plugin config or provide the
`OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_*` environment variables.

OAuth does not replace the Chrome join path. Chrome and Chrome-node transports
still join through a signed-in Chrome profile, BlackHole/SoX, and a connected
node when you use browser participation. OAuth is only for the official Google
Meet API path: create meeting spaces, resolve spaces, and run Meet Media API
preflight checks.

### Create Google credentials

In Google Cloud Console:

1. Create or select a Google Cloud project.
2. Enable **Google Meet REST API** for that project.
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen.
   - **Internal** is simplest for a Google Workspace organization.
   - **External** works for personal/test setups; while the app is in Testing,
     add each Google account that will authorize the app as a test user.
4. Add the scopes OpenClaw requests:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.settings`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.conference.media.readonly`
5. Create an OAuth client ID.
   - Application type: **Web application**.
   - Authorized redirect URI:

     ```text
     http://localhost:8085/oauth2callback
     ```

6. Copy the client ID and client secret.

`meetings.space.created` is required by Google Meet `spaces.create`.
`meetings.space.readonly` lets OpenClaw resolve Meet URLs/codes to spaces.
`meetings.space.settings` lets OpenClaw pass `SpaceConfig` settings such as
`accessType` during API room creation.
`meetings.conference.media.readonly` is for Meet Media API preflight and media
work; Google may require Developer Preview enrollment for actual Media API use.
If you only need browser-based Chrome joins, skip OAuth entirely.

### Mint the refresh token

Configure `oauth.clientId` and optionally `oauth.clientSecret`, or pass them as
environment variables, then run:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet auth login --json
```

The command prints an `oauth` config block with a refresh token. It uses PKCE,
localhost callback on `http://localhost:8085/oauth2callback`, and a manual
copy/paste flow with `--manual`.

Examples:

```bash
OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id" \
OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret" \
openclaw googlemeet auth login --json
```

Use manual mode when the browser cannot reach the local callback:

```bash
OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id" \
OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret" \
openclaw googlemeet auth login --json --manual
```

The JSON output includes:

```json
{
  "oauth": {
    "clientId": "your-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
    "refreshToken": "refresh-token",
    "accessToken": "access-token",
    "expiresAt": 1770000000000
  },
  "scope": "..."
}
```

Store the `oauth` object under the Google Meet plugin config:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "google-meet": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          oauth: {
            clientId: "your-client-id",
            clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
            refreshToken: "refresh-token",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Prefer environment variables when you do not want the refresh token in config.
If both config and environment values are present, the plugin resolves config
first and then environment fallback.

The OAuth consent includes Meet space creation, Meet space read access, and Meet
conference media read access. If you authenticated before meeting creation
support existed, rerun `openclaw googlemeet auth login --json` so the refresh
token has the `meetings.space.created` scope.

### Verify OAuth with doctor

Run the OAuth doctor when you want a fast, non-secret health check:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet doctor --oauth --json
```

This does not load the Chrome runtime or require a connected Chrome node. It
checks that OAuth config exists and that the refresh token can mint an access
token. The JSON report includes only status fields such as `ok`, `configured`,
`tokenSource`, `expiresAt`, and check messages; it does not print the access
token, refresh token, or client secret.

Common results:

| Check                | Meaning                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `oauth-config`       | `oauth.clientId` plus `oauth.refreshToken`, or a cached access token, is present.       |
| `oauth-token`        | The cached access token is still valid, or the refresh token minted a new access token. |
| `meet-spaces-get`    | Optional `--meeting` check resolved an existing Meet space.                             |
| `meet-spaces-create` | Optional `--create-space` check created a new Meet space.                               |

To prove Google Meet API enablement and `spaces.create` scope as well, run the
side-effecting create check:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet doctor --oauth --create-space --json
openclaw googlemeet create --no-join --json
```

`--create-space` creates a throwaway Meet URL. Use it when you need to confirm
that the Google Cloud project has the Meet API enabled and that the authorized
account has the `meetings.space.created` scope.

To prove read access for an existing meeting space:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet doctor --oauth --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij --json
openclaw googlemeet resolve-space --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

`doctor --oauth --meeting` and `resolve-space` prove read access to an existing
space that the authorized Google account can access. A `403` from these checks
usually means the Google Meet REST API is disabled, the consented refresh token
is missing the required scope, or the Google account cannot access that Meet
space. A refresh-token error means rerun `openclaw googlemeet auth login
--json` and store the new `oauth` block.

No OAuth credentials are needed for the browser fallback. In that mode, Google
auth comes from the signed-in Chrome profile on the selected node, not from
OpenClaw config.

These environment variables are accepted as fallbacks:

- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_ID`
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_SECRET` or `GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_REFRESH_TOKEN` or `GOOGLE_MEET_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `GOOGLE_MEET_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT` or
  `GOOGLE_MEET_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT`
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_DEFAULT_MEETING` or `GOOGLE_MEET_DEFAULT_MEETING`
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_PREVIEW_ACK` or `GOOGLE_MEET_PREVIEW_ACK`

Resolve a Meet URL, code, or `spaces/{id}` through `spaces.get`:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet resolve-space --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

Run preflight before media work:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet preflight --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

List meeting artifacts and attendance after Meet has created conference records:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet artifacts --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
openclaw googlemeet attendance --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
openclaw googlemeet export --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij --output ./meet-export
```

With `--meeting`, `artifacts` and `attendance` use the latest conference record
by default. Pass `--all-conference-records` when you want every retained record
for that meeting.

Calendar lookup can resolve the meeting URL from Google Calendar before reading
Meet artifacts:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet latest --today
openclaw googlemeet calendar-events --today --json
openclaw googlemeet artifacts --event "Weekly sync"
openclaw googlemeet attendance --today --format csv --output attendance.csv
```

`--today` searches today's `primary` calendar for a Calendar event with a
Google Meet link. Use `--event <query>` to search matching event text, and
`--calendar <id>` for a non-primary calendar. Calendar lookup requires a fresh
OAuth login that includes the Calendar events readonly scope.
`calendar-events` previews the matching Meet events and marks the event that
`latest`, `artifacts`, `attendance`, or `export` will choose.

If you already know the conference record id, address it directly:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet latest --meeting https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
openclaw googlemeet artifacts --conference-record conferenceRecords/abc123 --json
openclaw googlemeet attendance --conference-record conferenceRecords/abc123 --json
```

End an active conference for an API-created space when you want to close the
room after the call:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet end-active-conference https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

This calls Google Meet `spaces.endActiveConference` and requires OAuth with the
`meetings.space.created` scope for a space the authorized account can manage.
OpenClaw accepts a Meet URL, meeting code, or `spaces/{id}` input and resolves it
to the API space resource before ending the active conference.
It is separate from `googlemeet leave`: `leave` stops OpenClaw's local/session
participation, while `end-active-conference` asks Google Meet to end the active
conference for the space.

Write a readable report:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet artifacts --conference-record conferenceRecords/abc123 \
  --format markdown --output meet-artifacts.md
openclaw googlemeet attendance --conference-record conferenceRecords/abc123 \
  --format markdown --output meet-attendance.md
openclaw googlemeet attendance --conference-record conferenceRecords/abc123 \
  --format csv --output meet-attendance.csv
openclaw googlemeet export --conference-record conferenceRecords/abc123 \
  --include-doc-bodies --zip --output meet-export
openclaw googlemeet export --conference-record conferenceRecords/abc123 \
  --include-doc-bodies --dry-run
```

`artifacts` returns conference record metadata plus participant, recording,
transcript, structured transcript-entry, and smart-note resource metadata when
Google exposes it for the meeting. Use `--no-transcript-entries` to skip
entry lookup for large meetings. `attendance` expands participants into
participant-session rows with first/last seen times, total session duration,
late/early-leave flags, and duplicate participant resources merged by signed-in
user or display name. Pass `--no-merge-duplicates` to keep raw participant
resources separate, `--late-after-minutes` to tune late detection, and
`--early-before-minutes` to tune early-leave detection.

`export` writes a folder containing `summary.md`, `attendance.csv`,
`transcript.md`, `artifacts.json`, `attendance.json`, and `manifest.json`.
`manifest.json` records the chosen input, export options, conference records,
output files, counts, token source, Calendar event when one was used, and any
partial retrieval warnings. Pass `--zip` to also write a portable archive next
to the folder. Pass `--include-doc-bodies` to export linked transcript and
smart-note Google Docs text through Google Drive `files.export`; this requires a
fresh OAuth login that includes the Drive Meet readonly scope. Without
`--include-doc-bodies`, exports include Meet metadata and structured transcript
entries only. If Google returns a partial artifact failure, such as a smart-note
listing, transcript-entry, or Drive document-body error, the summary and
manifest keep the warning instead of failing the whole export.
Use `--dry-run` to fetch the same artifact/attendance data and print the
manifest JSON without creating the folder or ZIP. That is useful before writing
a large export or when an agent only needs counts, selected records, and
warnings.

Agents can also create the same bundle through the `google_meet` tool:

```json
{
  "action": "export",
  "conferenceRecord": "conferenceRecords/abc123",
  "includeDocumentBodies": true,
  "outputDir": "meet-export",
  "zip": true
}
```

Set `"dryRun": true` to return only the export manifest and skip file writes.

Agents can also create an API-backed room with an explicit access policy:

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "transport": "chrome-node",
  "mode": "agent",
  "accessType": "OPEN"
}
```

And they can end the active conference for a known room:

```json
{
  "action": "end_active_conference",
  "meeting": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
}
```

For listen-first validation, agents should use `test_listen` before claiming the
meeting is useful:

```json
{
  "action": "test_listen",
  "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "transport": "chrome-node",
  "timeoutMs": 30000
}
```

Run the guarded live smoke against a real retained meeting:

```bash
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 \
OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_LIVE_MEETING=https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij \
pnpm test:live -- extensions/google-meet/google-meet.live.test.ts
```

Run the live listen-first browser probe against a meeting where someone will
speak with Meet captions available:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup --transport chrome-node --mode transcribe
openclaw googlemeet test-listen https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij --transport chrome-node --timeout-ms 30000
```

Live smoke environment:

- `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1` enables guarded live tests.
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_LIVE_MEETING` points at a retained Meet URL, code, or
  `spaces/{id}`.
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_ID` provides the OAuth
  client id.
- `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_REFRESH_TOKEN` or `GOOGLE_MEET_REFRESH_TOKEN` provides
  the refresh token.
- Optional: `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and
  `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT` use the same fallback names
  without the `OPENCLAW_` prefix.

The base artifact/attendance live smoke needs
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly` and
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.conference.media.readonly`. Calendar
lookup needs `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly`. Drive
document-body export needs
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.meet.readonly`.

Create a fresh Meet space:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet create
```

The command prints the new `meeting uri`, source, and join session. With OAuth
credentials it uses the official Google Meet API. Without OAuth credentials it
uses the pinned Chrome node's signed-in browser profile as a fallback. Agents can
use the `google_meet` tool with `action: "create"` to create and join in one
step. For URL-only creation, pass `"join": false`.

Example JSON output from the browser fallback:

```json
{
  "source": "browser",
  "meetingUri": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "joined": true,
  "browser": {
    "nodeId": "ba0f4e4bc...",
    "targetId": "tab-1"
  },
  "join": {
    "session": {
      "id": "meet_...",
      "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
    }
  }
}
```

If the browser fallback hits Google login or a Meet permission blocker before it
can create the URL, the Gateway method returns a failed response and the
`google_meet` tool returns structured details instead of a plain string:

```json
{
  "source": "browser",
  "error": "google-login-required: Sign in to Google in the OpenClaw browser profile, then retry meeting creation.",
  "manualActionRequired": true,
  "manualActionReason": "google-login-required",
  "manualActionMessage": "Sign in to Google in the OpenClaw browser profile, then retry meeting creation.",
  "browser": {
    "nodeId": "ba0f4e4bc...",
    "targetId": "tab-1",
    "browserUrl": "https://accounts.google.com/signin",
    "browserTitle": "Sign in - Google Accounts"
  }
}
```

When an agent sees `manualActionRequired: true`, it should report the
`manualActionMessage` plus the browser node/tab context and stop opening new
Meet tabs until the operator completes the browser step.

Example JSON output from API create:

```json
{
  "source": "api",
  "meetingUri": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "joined": true,
  "space": {
    "name": "spaces/abc-defg-hij",
    "meetingCode": "abc-defg-hij",
    "meetingUri": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
  },
  "join": {
    "session": {
      "id": "meet_...",
      "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
    }
  }
}
```

Creating a Meet joins by default. The Chrome or Chrome-node transport still
needs a signed-in Google Chrome profile to join through the browser. If the
profile is signed out, OpenClaw reports `manualActionRequired: true` or a
browser fallback error and asks the operator to finish Google login before
retrying.

Set `preview.enrollmentAcknowledged: true` only after confirming your Cloud
project, OAuth principal, and meeting participants are enrolled in the Google
Workspace Developer Preview Program for Meet media APIs.

## Config

The common Chrome agent path only needs the plugin enabled, BlackHole, SoX, a
realtime transcription provider key, and a configured OpenClaw TTS provider.
OpenAI is the default transcription provider; set `realtime.voiceProvider` to
`"google"` and `realtime.model` to use Google Gemini Live for `bidi` mode
without changing the default agent-mode transcription provider:

```bash
brew install blackhole-2ch sox
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# or
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

Set the plugin config under `plugins.entries.google-meet.config`:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "google-meet": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {},
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Defaults:

- `defaultTransport: "chrome"`
- `defaultMode: "agent"` (`"realtime"` is accepted only as a legacy
  compatibility alias for `"agent"`; new tool calls should say `"agent"`)
- `chromeNode.node`: optional node id/name/IP for `chrome-node`
- `chrome.audioBackend: "blackhole-2ch"`
- `chrome.guestName: "OpenClaw Agent"`: name used on the signed-out Meet guest
  screen
- `chrome.autoJoin: true`: best-effort guest-name fill and Join Now click
  through OpenClaw browser automation on `chrome-node`
- `chrome.reuseExistingTab: true`: activate an existing Meet tab instead of
  opening duplicates
- `chrome.waitForInCallMs: 20000`: wait for the Meet tab to report in-call
  before the talk-back intro is triggered
- `chrome.audioFormat: "pcm16-24khz"`: command-pair audio format. Use
  `"g711-ulaw-8khz"` only for legacy/custom command pairs that still emit
  telephony audio.
- `chrome.audioBufferBytes: 4096`: SoX processing buffer for generated Chrome
  command-pair audio commands. This is half of SoX's default 8192-byte buffer,
  reducing default pipe latency while leaving room to raise it on busy hosts.
  Values below SoX's minimum are clamped to 17 bytes.
- `chrome.audioInputCommand`: SoX command reading from CoreAudio `BlackHole 2ch`
  and writing audio in `chrome.audioFormat`
- `chrome.audioOutputCommand`: SoX command reading audio in `chrome.audioFormat`
  and writing to CoreAudio `BlackHole 2ch`
- `chrome.bargeInInputCommand`: optional local microphone command that writes
  signed 16-bit little-endian mono PCM for human barge-in detection while
  assistant playback is active. This currently applies to the Gateway-hosted
  `chrome` command-pair bridge.
- `chrome.bargeInRmsThreshold: 650`: RMS level that counts as a human
  interruption on `chrome.bargeInInputCommand`
- `chrome.bargeInPeakThreshold: 2500`: peak level that counts as a human
  interruption on `chrome.bargeInInputCommand`
- `chrome.bargeInCooldownMs: 900`: minimum delay between repeated human
  interruption clears
- `mode: "agent"`: default talk-back mode. Participant speech is transcribed by
  the configured realtime transcription provider, sent to the configured
  OpenClaw agent in a per-meeting sub-agent session, and spoken back through the
  normal OpenClaw TTS runtime.
- `mode: "bidi"`: fallback direct bidirectional realtime model mode. The
  realtime voice provider answers participant speech directly and may call
  `openclaw_agent_consult` for deeper/tool-backed answers.
- `mode: "transcribe"`: observe-only mode without the talk-back bridge.
- `realtime.provider: "openai"`: compatibility fallback used when the scoped
  provider fields below are unset.
- `realtime.transcriptionProvider: "openai"`: provider id used by `agent` mode
  for realtime transcription.
- `realtime.voiceProvider`: provider id used by `bidi` mode for direct realtime
  voice. Set this to `"google"` to use Gemini Live while keeping agent-mode
  transcription on OpenAI.
- `realtime.toolPolicy: "safe-read-only"`
- `realtime.instructions`: brief spoken replies, with
  `openclaw_agent_consult` for deeper answers
- `realtime.introMessage`: short spoken readiness check when the realtime bridge
  connects; set it to `""` to join silently
- `realtime.agentId`: optional OpenClaw agent id for
  `openclaw_agent_consult`; defaults to `main`

Optional overrides:

    providers: {
      google: {
        speakerVoice: "Kore",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

ElevenLabs for both agent-mode listening and speaking:

```json5
{
  messages: {
    tts: {
      provider: "elevenlabs",
      providers: {
        elevenlabs: {
          modelId: "eleven_v3",
          speakerVoiceId: "pMsXgVXv3BLzUgSXRplE",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "google-meet": {
        config: {
          realtime: {
            transcriptionProvider: "elevenlabs",
            providers: {
              elevenlabs: {
                modelId: "scribe_v2_realtime",
                audioFormat: "ulaw_8000",
                sampleRate: 8000,
                commitStrategy: "vad",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The persistent Meet voice comes from
`messages.tts.providers.elevenlabs.speakerVoiceId`. Agent replies can also use
per-reply `[[tts:speakerVoiceId=... model=eleven_v3]]` directives when TTS model
overrides are enabled, but config is the deterministic default for meetings.
On join, the logs should show `transcriptionProvider=elevenlabs` and each
spoken reply should log `provider=elevenlabs model=eleven_v3 speakerVoiceId=<voiceId>`.

Twilio-only config:

```json5
{
  defaultTransport: "twilio",
  twilio: {
    defaultDialInNumber: "+15551234567",
    defaultPin: "123456",
  },
  voiceCall: {
    gatewayUrl: "ws://127.0.0.1:18789",
  },
}
```

`voiceCall.enabled` defaults to `true`; with Twilio transport it delegates the
actual PSTN call, DTMF, and intro greeting to the Voice Call plugin. Voice Call
plays the DTMF sequence before opening the realtime media stream, then uses the
saved intro text as the initial realtime greeting. If `voice-call` is not
enabled, Google Meet can still validate and record the dial plan, but it cannot
place the Twilio call.

## Tool

Agents can use the `google_meet` tool:

```json
{
  "action": "join",
  "url": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  "transport": "chrome-node",
  "mode": "agent"
}
```

Use `transport: "chrome"` when Chrome runs on the Gateway host. Use
`transport: "chrome-node"` when Chrome runs on a paired node such as a Parallels
VM. In both cases the model providers and `openclaw_agent_consult` run on the
Gateway host, so model credentials stay there. With the default `mode: "agent"`,
the realtime transcription provider handles listening, the configured OpenClaw
agent produces the answer, and regular OpenClaw TTS speaks it into Meet. Use
`mode: "bidi"` when you want the realtime voice model to answer directly.
Raw `mode: "realtime"` remains accepted as a legacy compatibility alias for
`mode: "agent"`, but it is no longer advertised in the agent tool schema.
Agent-mode logs include the resolved transcription provider/model at bridge
startup and the TTS provider, model, voice, output format, and sample rate after
each synthesized reply.

Use `action: "status"` to list active sessions or inspect a session ID. Use
`action: "speak"` with `sessionId` and `message` to make the realtime agent
speak immediately. Use `action: "test_speech"` to create or reuse the session,
trigger a known phrase, and return `inCall` health when the Chrome host can
report it. `test_speech` always forces `mode: "agent"` and fails if asked to
run in `mode: "transcribe"` because observe-only sessions intentionally cannot
emit speech. Its `speechOutputVerified` result is based on realtime audio output
bytes increasing during this test call, so a reused session with older audio
does not count as a fresh successful speech check. Use `action: "leave"` to mark
a session ended.

`status` includes Chrome health when available:

- `inCall`: Chrome appears to be inside the Meet call
- `micMuted`: best-effort Meet microphone state
- `manualActionRequired` / `manualActionReason` / `manualActionMessage`: the
  browser profile needs manual login, Meet host admission, permissions, or
  browser-control repair before speech can work
- `speechReady` / `speechBlockedReason` / `speechBlockedMessage`: whether
  managed Chrome speech is allowed now. `speechReady: false` means OpenClaw did
  not send the intro/test phrase into the audio bridge.
- `providerConnected` / `realtimeReady`: realtime voice bridge state
- `lastInputAt` / `lastOutputAt`: last audio seen from or sent to the bridge
- `audioOutputRouted` / `audioOutputDeviceLabel`: whether the Meet tab's media
  output was actively routed to the BlackHole device used by the bridge
- `lastSuppressedInputAt` / `suppressedInputBytes`: loopback input ignored while
  assistant playback is active

```json
{
  "action": "speak",
  "sessionId": "meet_...",
  "message": "Say exactly: I'm here and listening."
}
```

## Agent and bidi modes

Chrome `agent` mode is optimized for "my agent is in the meeting" behavior. The
realtime transcription provider hears the meeting audio, final participant
transcripts are routed through the configured OpenClaw agent, and the answer is
spoken through the normal OpenClaw TTS runtime. Set `mode: "bidi"` when you want
the realtime voice model to answer directly.
Nearby final transcript fragments are coalesced before the consult so one spoken
turn does not produce several stale partial answers. Realtime input is also
suppressed while queued assistant audio is still playing,
and recent assistant-like transcript echoes are ignored before the agent consult
so BlackHole loopback does not make the agent answer its own speech.

| Mode    | Who decides the answer        | Speech output path                     | Use when                                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent` | The configured OpenClaw agent | Normal OpenClaw TTS runtime            | You want "my agent is in the meeting" behavior        |
| `bidi`  | The realtime voice model      | Realtime voice provider audio response | You want the lowest-latency conversational voice loop |

In `bidi` mode, when the realtime model needs deeper reasoning, current
information, or normal OpenClaw tools, it can call `openclaw_agent_consult`.

The consult tool runs the regular OpenClaw agent behind the scenes with recent
meeting transcript context and returns a concise spoken answer. In `agent` mode,
OpenClaw sends that answer directly to the TTS runtime; in `bidi` mode, the
realtime voice model can speak the consult result back into the meeting. It uses
the same shared consult machinery as Voice Call.

By default, consults run against the `main` agent. Set `realtime.agentId` when a
Meet lane should consult a dedicated OpenClaw agent workspace, model defaults,
tool policy, memory, and session history.

Agent-mode consults use a per-meeting `agent:<id>:subagent:google-meet:<session>`
session key so follow-up questions keep meeting context while inheriting normal
agent policy from the configured agent.

`realtime.toolPolicy` controls the consult run:

- `safe-read-only`: expose the consult tool and limit the regular agent to
  `read`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `x_search`, `memory_search`, and
  `memory_get`.
- `owner`: expose the consult tool and let the regular agent use the normal
  agent tool policy.
- `none`: do not expose the consult tool to the realtime voice model.

The consult session key is scoped per Meet session, so follow-up consult calls
can reuse prior consult context during the same meeting.

To force a spoken readiness check after Chrome has fully joined the call:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet speak meet_... "Say exactly: I'm here and listening."
```

For the full join-and-speak smoke:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet test-speech https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij \
  --transport chrome-node \
  --message "Say exactly: I'm here and listening."
```

## Live test checklist

Use this sequence before handing a meeting to an unattended agent:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup
openclaw nodes status
openclaw googlemeet test-speech https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij \
  --transport chrome-node \
  --message "Say exactly: Google Meet speech test complete."
```

Expected Chrome-node state:

- `googlemeet setup` is all green.
- `googlemeet setup` includes `chrome-node-connected` when Chrome-node is the
  default transport or a node is pinned.
- `nodes status` shows the selected node connected.
- The selected node advertises both `googlemeet.chrome` and `browser.proxy`.
- The Meet tab joins the call and `test-speech` returns Chrome health with
  `inCall: true`.

For a remote Chrome host such as a Parallels macOS VM, this is the shortest
safe check after updating the Gateway or the VM:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup
openclaw nodes status --connected
openclaw nodes invoke \
  --node parallels-macos \
  --command googlemeet.chrome \
  --params '{"action":"setup"}'
```

That proves the Gateway plugin is loaded, the VM node is connected with the
current token, and the Meet audio bridge is available before an agent opens a
real meeting tab.

For a Twilio smoke, use a meeting that exposes phone dial-in details:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij \
  --transport twilio \
  --dial-in-number +15551234567 \
  --pin 123456
```

Expected Twilio state:

- `googlemeet setup` includes green `twilio-voice-call-plugin`,
  `twilio-voice-call-credentials`, and `twilio-voice-call-webhook` checks.
- `voicecall` is available in the CLI after Gateway reload.
- The returned session has `transport: "twilio"` and a `twilio.voiceCallId`.
- `openclaw logs --follow` shows DTMF TwiML served before realtime TwiML, then a
  realtime bridge with the initial greeting queued.
- `googlemeet leave <sessionId>` hangs up the delegated voice call.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent cannot see the Google Meet tool

Confirm the plugin is enabled in the Gateway config and reload the Gateway:

```bash
openclaw plugins list | grep google-meet
openclaw googlemeet setup
```

If you just edited `plugins.entries.google-meet`, restart or reload the Gateway.
The running agent only sees plugin tools registered by the current Gateway
process.

On non-macOS Gateway hosts, the agent-facing `google_meet` tool stays visible,
but local Chrome talk-back actions are blocked before they hit the audio bridge.
Local Chrome talk-back audio currently depends on macOS `BlackHole 2ch`, so
Linux agents should use `mode: "transcribe"`, Twilio dial-in, or a macOS
`chrome-node` host instead of the default local Chrome agent path.

### No connected Google Meet-capable node

On the node host, run:

```bash
openclaw plugins enable google-meet
openclaw plugins enable browser
OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1 \
  openclaw node run --host <gateway-lan-ip> --port 18789 --display-name parallels-macos
```

On the Gateway host, approve the node and verify commands:

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
openclaw nodes status
```

The node must be connected and list `googlemeet.chrome` plus `browser.proxy`.
The Gateway config must allow those node commands:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    nodes: {
      allowCommands: ["browser.proxy", "googlemeet.chrome"],
    },
  },
}
```

If `googlemeet setup` fails `chrome-node-connected` or the Gateway log reports
`gateway token mismatch`, reinstall or restart the node with the current Gateway
token. For a LAN Gateway this usually means:

```bash
OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1 \
  openclaw node install \
  --host <gateway-lan-ip> \
  --port 18789 \
  --display-name parallels-macos \
  --force
```

Then reload the node service and re-run:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup
openclaw nodes status --connected
```

### Browser opens but agent cannot join

Run `googlemeet test-listen` for observe-only joins or `googlemeet test-speech`
for realtime joins, then inspect the returned Chrome health. If either probe
reports `manualActionRequired: true`, show `manualActionMessage` to the operator
and stop retrying until the browser action is complete.

Common manual actions:

- Sign in to the Chrome profile.
- Admit the guest from the Meet host account.
- Grant Chrome microphone/camera permissions when Chrome's native permission
  prompt appears.
- Close or repair a stuck Meet permission dialog.

Do not report "not signed in" just because Meet shows "Do you want people to
hear you in the meeting?" That is Meet's audio-choice interstitial; OpenClaw
clicks **Use microphone** through browser automation when available and keeps
waiting for the real meeting state. For create-only browser fallback, OpenClaw
may click **Continue without microphone** because creating the URL does not need
the realtime audio path.

### Meeting creation fails

`googlemeet create` first uses the Google Meet API `spaces.create` endpoint
when OAuth credentials are configured. Without OAuth credentials it falls back
to the pinned Chrome node browser. Confirm:

- For API creation: `oauth.clientId` and `oauth.refreshToken` are configured,
  or matching `OPENCLAW_GOOGLE_MEET_*` environment variables are present.
- For API creation: the refresh token was minted after create support was
  added. Older tokens may be missing the `meetings.space.created` scope; rerun
  `openclaw googlemeet auth login --json` and update plugin config.
- For browser fallback: `defaultTransport: "chrome-node"` and
  `chromeNode.node` point at a connected node with `browser.proxy` and
  `googlemeet.chrome`.
- For browser fallback: the OpenClaw Chrome profile on that node is signed in
  to Google and can open `https://meet.google.com/new`.
- For browser fallback: retries reuse an existing `https://meet.google.com/new`
  or Google account prompt tab before opening a new tab. If an agent times out,
  retry the tool call rather than manually opening another Meet tab.
- For browser fallback: if the tool returns `manualActionRequired: true`, use
  the returned `browser.nodeId`, `browser.targetId`, `browserUrl`, and
  `manualActionMessage` to guide the operator. Do not retry in a loop until that
  action is complete.
- For browser fallback: if Meet shows "Do you want people to hear you in the
  meeting?", leave the tab open. OpenClaw should click **Use microphone** or, for
  create-only fallback, **Continue without microphone** through browser
  automation and continue waiting for the generated Meet URL. If it cannot, the
  error should mention `meet-audio-choice-required`, not `google-login-required`.

### Agent joins but does not talk

Check the realtime path:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup
openclaw googlemeet doctor
```

Use `mode: "agent"` for the normal STT -> OpenClaw agent -> TTS talk-back path,
or `mode: "bidi"` for the direct realtime voice fallback. `mode: "transcribe"`
intentionally does not start the talk-back bridge. For observe-only debugging,
run `openclaw googlemeet status --json <session-id>` after participants speak
and check `captioning`, `transcriptLines`, and `lastCaptionText`. If `inCall` is
true but `transcriptLines` stays at `0`, Meet captions may be disabled, no one
has spoken since the observer was installed, the Meet UI changed, or live
captions are unavailable for the meeting language/account.

`googlemeet test-speech` always checks the realtime path and reports whether
bridge output bytes were observed for that invocation. If `speechOutputVerified` is false and
`speechOutputTimedOut` is true, the realtime provider may have accepted the
utterance but OpenClaw did not see new output bytes reach the Chrome audio
bridge.

Also verify:

- A realtime provider key is available on the Gateway host, such as
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- `BlackHole 2ch` is visible on the Chrome host.
- `sox` exists on the Chrome host.
- Meet microphone and speaker are routed through the virtual audio path used by
  OpenClaw. `doctor` should show `meet output routed: yes` for local Chrome
  realtime joins.

`googlemeet doctor [session-id]` prints the session, node, in-call state,
manual action reason, realtime provider connection, `realtimeReady`, audio
input/output activity, last audio timestamps, byte counters, and browser URL.
Use `googlemeet status [session-id] --json` when you need the raw JSON. Use
`googlemeet doctor --oauth` when you need to verify Google Meet OAuth refresh
without exposing tokens; add `--meeting` or `--create-space` when you need a
Google Meet API proof as well.

If an agent timed out and you can see a Meet tab already open, inspect that tab
without opening another one:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet recover-tab
openclaw googlemeet recover-tab https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

The equivalent tool action is `recover_current_tab`. It focuses and inspects an
existing Meet tab for the selected transport. With `chrome`, it uses local
browser control through the Gateway; with `chrome-node`, it uses the configured
Chrome node. It does not open a new tab or create a new session; it reports the
current blocker, such as login, admission, permissions, or audio-choice state.
The CLI command talks to the configured Gateway, so the Gateway must be running;
`chrome-node` also requires the Chrome node to be connected.

### Twilio setup checks fail

`twilio-voice-call-plugin` fails when `voice-call` is not allowed or not enabled.
Add it to `plugins.allow`, enable `plugins.entries.voice-call`, and reload the
Gateway.

`twilio-voice-call-credentials` fails when the Twilio backend is missing account
SID, auth token, or caller number. Set these on the Gateway host:

```bash
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
export TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+15550001234
```

`twilio-voice-call-webhook` fails when `voice-call` has no public webhook
exposure, or when `publicUrl` points at loopback or private network space.
Set `plugins.entries.voice-call.config.publicUrl` to the public provider URL or
configure a `voice-call` tunnel/Tailscale exposure.

Loopback and private URLs are not valid for carrier callbacks. Do not use
`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `10.x`, `172.16.x`-`172.31.x`,
`192.168.x`, `169.254.x`, `fc00::/7`, or `fd00::/8` as `publicUrl`.

For a stable public URL:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "voice-call": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          provider: "twilio",
          fromNumber: "+15550001234",
          publicUrl: "https://voice.example.com/voice/webhook",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

For local development, use a tunnel or Tailscale exposure instead of a private
host URL:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      "voice-call": {
        config: {
          tunnel: { provider: "ngrok" },
          // or
          tailscale: { mode: "funnel", path: "/voice/webhook" },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Then restart or reload the Gateway and run:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet setup --transport twilio
openclaw voicecall setup
openclaw voicecall smoke
```

`voicecall smoke` is readiness-only by default. To dry-run a specific number:

```bash
openclaw voicecall smoke --to "+15555550123"
```

Only add `--yes` when you intentionally want to place a live outbound notify
call:

```bash
openclaw voicecall smoke --to "+15555550123" --yes
```

### Twilio call starts but never enters the meeting

Confirm the Meet event exposes phone dial-in details. Pass the exact dial-in
number and PIN or a custom DTMF sequence:

```bash
openclaw googlemeet join https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij \
  --transport twilio \
  --dial-in-number +15551234567 \
  --dtmf-sequence ww123456#
```

Use leading `w` or commas in `--dtmf-sequence` if the provider needs a pause
before entering the PIN.

If the phone call is created but the Meet roster never shows the dial-in
participant:

- Run `openclaw googlemeet doctor <session-id>` to confirm the delegated Twilio
  call ID, whether DTMF was queued, and whether the intro greeting was requested.
- Run `openclaw voicecall status --call-id <id>` and confirm the call is still
  active.
- Run `openclaw voicecall tail` and check that Twilio webhooks are arriving at
  the Gateway.
- Run `openclaw logs --follow` and look for the Twilio Meet sequence: Google
  Meet delegates the join, Voice Call stores and serves pre-connect DTMF TwiML,
  Voice Call serves realtime TwiML for the Twilio call, then Google Meet requests
  intro speech with `voicecall.speak`.
- Re-run `openclaw googlemeet setup --transport twilio`; a green setup check is
  required but does not prove the meeting PIN sequence is correct.
- Confirm the dial-in number belongs to the same Meet invitation and region as
  the PIN.
- Increase `voiceCall.dtmfDelayMs` from the 12-second default if Meet answers
  slowly or the call transcript still shows the prompt asking for a PIN after
  pre-connect DTMF was sent.
- If the participant joins but you do not hear the greeting, check
  `openclaw logs --follow` for the post-DTMF `voicecall.speak` request and
  either media-stream TTS playback or the Twilio `<Say>` fallback. If the call
  transcript still contains "enter the meeting PIN", the phone leg has not joined
  the Meet room yet, so meeting participants will not hear speech.

If webhooks do not arrive, debug the Voice Call plugin first: the provider must
reach `plugins.entries.voice-call.config.publicUrl` or the configured tunnel.
See [Voice call troubleshooting](/plugins/voice-call#troubleshooting).

## Notes

Google Meet's official media API is receive-oriented, so speaking into a Meet
call still needs a participant path. This plugin keeps that boundary visible:
Chrome handles browser participation and local audio routing; Twilio handles
phone dial-in participation.

Chrome talk-back modes need `BlackHole 2ch` plus either:

- `chrome.audioInputCommand` plus `chrome.audioOutputCommand`: OpenClaw owns the
  bridge and pipes audio in `chrome.audioFormat` between those commands and the
  selected provider. Agent mode uses realtime transcription plus regular TTS;
  bidi mode uses the realtime voice provider. The default Chrome path is 24 kHz
  PCM16 with `chrome.audioBufferBytes: 4096`; 8 kHz G.711 mu-law remains
  available for legacy command pairs.
- `chrome.audioBridgeCommand`: an external bridge command owns the whole local
  audio path and must exit after starting or validating its daemon. This is only
  valid for `bidi` because `agent` mode needs direct command-pair access for TTS.

When an agent calls the `google_meet` tool in agent mode, the meeting consultant
session forks the caller's current transcript before answering participant
speech. The Meet session still stays separate (`agent:<agentId>:subagent:google-meet:<sessionId>`)
so meeting follow-ups do not mutate the caller transcript directly.

For clean duplex audio, route Meet output and Meet microphone through separate
virtual devices or a Loopback-style virtual device graph. A single shared
BlackHole device can echo other participants back into the call.

With the command-pair Chrome bridge, `chrome.bargeInInputCommand` can listen to a
separate local microphone and clear assistant playback when the human starts
talking. This keeps human speech ahead of assistant output even when the shared
BlackHole loopback input is temporarily suppressed during assistant playback.
Like `chrome.audioInputCommand` and `chrome.audioOutputCommand`, it is an
operator-configured local command. Use an explicit trusted command path or
argument list, and do not point it at scripts from untrusted locations.

`googlemeet speak` triggers the active talk-back audio bridge for a Chrome
session. `googlemeet leave` stops that bridge. For Twilio sessions delegated
through the Voice Call plugin, `leave` also hangs up the underlying voice call.
Use `googlemeet end-active-conference` when you also want to close the active
Google Meet conference for an API-managed space.

title: "System prompt"

OpenClaw builds a custom system prompt for every agent run. The prompt is **OpenClaw-owned** and does not use a runtime default prompt.

The prompt is assembled by OpenClaw and injected into each agent run.

Prompt assembly has three layers:

- `buildAgentSystemPrompt` renders the prompt from explicit inputs. It should
  stay a pure renderer and should not read global config directly.
- `resolveAgentSystemPromptConfig` resolves config-backed prompt knobs such as
  owner display, TTS hints, model aliases, memory citation mode, and sub-agent
  delegation mode for a specific agent.
- Runtime adapters (embedded, CLI, command/export previews, compaction) gather
  live facts such as tools, sandbox state, channel capabilities, context files,
  and provider prompt contributions, then call the configured prompt facade.

This keeps exported/debug prompt surfaces aligned with live runs without
turning every runtime-specific detail into one monolithic builder.

Provider plugins can contribute cache-aware prompt guidance without replacing
the full OpenClaw-owned prompt. The provider runtime can:

- replace a small set of named core sections (`interaction_style`,
  `tool_call_style`, `execution_bias`)
- inject a **stable prefix** above the prompt cache boundary
- inject a **dynamic suffix** below the prompt cache boundary

Use provider-owned contributions for model-family-specific tuning. Keep legacy
`before_prompt_build` prompt mutation for compatibility or truly global prompt
changes, not normal provider behavior.

The OpenAI GPT-5 family overlay keeps the core execution rule small and adds
model-specific guidance for persona latching, concise output, tool discipline,
parallel lookup, deliverable coverage, verification, missing context, and
terminal-tool hygiene.

## Structure

The prompt is intentionally compact and uses fixed sections:

- **Tooling**: structured-tool source-of-truth reminder plus runtime tool-use guidance.
- **Execution Bias**: compact follow-through guidance: act in-turn on
  actionable requests, continue until done or blocked, recover from weak tool
  results, check mutable state live, and verify before finalizing.
- **Safety**: short guardrail reminder to avoid power-seeking behavior or bypassing oversight.
- **Skills** (when available): tells the model how to load skill instructions on demand.
- **OpenClaw Control**: tells the model to prefer the `gateway` tool for
  config/restart work and to avoid inventing CLI commands.
- **OpenClaw Self-Update**: how to inspect config safely with
  `config.schema.lookup`, patch config with `config.patch`, replace the full
  config with `config.apply`, and run `update.run` only on explicit user
  request. The agent-facing `gateway` tool also refuses to rewrite
  `tools.exec.ask` / `tools.exec.security`, including legacy `tools.bash.*`
  aliases that normalize to those protected exec paths.
- **Workspace**: working directory (`agents.defaults.workspace`).
- **Documentation**: local path to OpenClaw docs/source and when to read them.
- **Workspace Files (injected)**: indicates bootstrap files are included below.
- **Sandbox** (when enabled): indicates sandboxed runtime, sandbox paths, and whether elevated exec is available.
- **Current Date & Time**: time zone only (cache-stable; the live clock comes from `session_status`).
- **Assistant Output Directives**: compact attachment, voice-note, and reply tag syntax.
- **Heartbeats**: heartbeat prompt and ack behavior, when heartbeats are enabled for the default agent.
- **Runtime**: host, OS, node, model, repo root (when detected), thinking level (one line).
- **Reasoning**: current visibility level + /reasoning toggle hint.

OpenClaw keeps large stable content, including **Project Context**, above the
internal prompt cache boundary. Volatile channel/session sections such as
Control UI embed guidance, **Messaging**, **Voice**, **Group Chat Context**,
**Reactions**, **Heartbeats**, and **Runtime** are appended below that boundary
so local backends with prefix caches can reuse the stable workspace prefix
across channel turns. Tool descriptions should likewise avoid embedding current
channel names when the accepted schema already carries that runtime detail.

The Tooling section also includes runtime guidance for long-running work:

- use cron for future follow-up (`check back later`, reminders, recurring work)
  instead of `exec` sleep loops, `yieldMs` delay tricks, or repeated `process`
  polling
- use `exec` / `process` only for commands that start now and continue running
  in the background
- when automatic completion wake is enabled, start the command once and rely on
  the push-based wake path when it emits output or fails
- use `process` for logs, status, input, or intervention when you need to
  inspect a running command
- if the task is larger, prefer `sessions_spawn`; sub-agent completion is
  push-based and auto-announces back to the requester
- do not poll `subagents list` / `sessions_list` in a loop just to wait for
  completion

`agents.defaults.subagents.delegationMode` can strengthen this guidance. The
default `suggest` mode keeps the baseline nudge. `prefer` adds a dedicated
**Sub-Agent Delegation** section telling the main agent to act as a responsive
coordinator and push anything more involved than a direct reply through
`sessions_spawn`. This is prompt-only; tool policy still controls whether
`sessions_spawn` is available.

When the experimental `update_plan` tool is enabled, Tooling also tells the
model to use it only for non-trivial multi-step work, keep exactly one
`in_progress` step, and avoid repeating the whole plan after each update.

Safety guardrails in the system prompt are advisory. They guide model behavior but do not enforce policy. Use tool policy, exec approvals, sandboxing, and channel allowlists for hard enforcement; operators can disable these by design.

On channels with native approval cards/buttons, the runtime prompt now tells the
agent to rely on that native approval UI first. It should only include a manual
`/approve` command when the tool result says chat approvals are unavailable or
manual approval is the only path.

## Prompt modes

OpenClaw can render smaller system prompts for sub-agents. The runtime sets a
`promptMode` for each run (not a user-facing config):

- `full` (default): includes all sections above.
- `minimal`: used for sub-agents; omits **Memory Recall**, **OpenClaw
  Self-Update**, **Model Aliases**, **User Identity**, **Assistant Output Directives**,
  **Messaging**, **Silent Replies**, and **Heartbeats**. Tooling, **Safety**,
  **Skills** when supplied, Workspace, Sandbox, Current Date & Time (when
  known), Runtime, and injected context stay available.
- `none`: returns only the base identity line.

When `promptMode=minimal`, extra injected prompts are labeled **Subagent
Context** instead of **Group Chat Context**.

For channel auto-reply runs, OpenClaw omits the generic **Silent Replies**
section when direct, group, or message-tool-only context owns the visible-reply
contract. Only old automatic group/channel mode should show `NO_REPLY`; direct
chats and message-tool-only replies do not receive silent-token guidance.

## Prompt snapshots

OpenClaw keeps committed prompt snapshots for the Codex runtime happy path under
`test/fixtures/agents/prompt-snapshots/codex-runtime-happy-path/`. They render
selected app-server thread/turn params plus a reconstructed model-bound prompt
layer stack for Telegram direct, Discord group, and heartbeat turns. That stack
includes a pinned Codex `gpt-5.5` model prompt fixture generated from Codex's
model catalog/cache shape, the Codex happy-path permission developer text,
OpenClaw developer instructions, turn-scoped collaboration-mode instructions
when OpenClaw provides them, user turn input, and references to the dynamic tool
specs.

Refresh the pinned Codex model prompt fixture with
`pnpm prompt:snapshots:sync-codex-model`. By default, the script looks for
Codex's runtime cache at `$CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json`, then
`~/.codex/models_cache.json`, and only then falls back to the maintainer Codex
checkout convention at `~/code/codex/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json`. If
none of those sources exist, the command exits without changing the committed
fixture. Pass `--catalog <path>` to refresh from a specific `models_cache.json`
or `models.json` file.

These snapshots are still not a byte-for-byte raw OpenAI request capture. Codex
can add runtime-owned workspace context such as `AGENTS.md`, environment
context, memories, app/plugin instructions, and built-in Default
collaboration-mode instructions inside the Codex runtime after OpenClaw sends
thread and turn params.

Regenerate them with `pnpm prompt:snapshots:gen` and verify drift with
`pnpm prompt:snapshots:check`. CI runs the drift check in the additional
boundary shard so prompt changes and snapshot updates stay attached to the same
PR.

## Workspace bootstrap injection

Bootstrap files are resolved from the active workspace, then routed to the
prompt surface that matches their lifetime:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `TOOLS.md`
- `IDENTITY.md`
- `USER.md`
- `HEARTBEAT.md`
- `BOOTSTRAP.md` (only on brand-new workspaces)
- `MEMORY.md` when present

On the native Codex harness, OpenClaw avoids repeating stable workspace files
in every user turn. Codex loads `AGENTS.md` through its own project-doc
discovery. `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `USER.md` are forwarded as
Codex developer instructions. The compact OpenClaw skills list is also forwarded
as turn-scoped collaboration developer instructions. `HEARTBEAT.md` content is
not injected; heartbeat turns get a collaboration-mode note pointing to the file
when it exists and is non-empty. `MEMORY.md` content from the configured agent
workspace is not pasted into every native Codex turn; when memory tools are
available for that workspace, Codex turns get a small workspace-memory note in
turn-scoped collaboration developer instructions and should use `memory_search`
or `memory_get` when durable memory is relevant. If tools are disabled, memory
search is unavailable, or the active workspace differs from the agent memory
workspace, `MEMORY.md` falls back to the normal bounded turn-context path. Active
`BOOTSTRAP.md` content keeps the normal turn-context role for now.

On non-Codex harnesses, bootstrap files continue to be composed into the
OpenClaw prompt according to their existing gates. `HEARTBEAT.md` is omitted on
normal runs when heartbeats are disabled for the default agent or
`agents.defaults.heartbeat.includeSystemPromptSection` is false. Keep injected
files concise, especially non-Codex `MEMORY.md`. `MEMORY.md` is intended to stay
a curated long-term summary; detailed daily notes belong in `memory/*.md` where
`memory_search` and `memory_get` can retrieve them on demand. Oversized
non-Codex `MEMORY.md` files increase prompt usage and can be partially injected
because of the bootstrap file limits below.

<Note>
`memory/*.md` daily files are **not** part of the normal bootstrap Project Context. On ordinary turns they are accessed on demand via the `memory_search` and `memory_get` tools, so they do not count against the context window unless the model explicitly reads them. Bare `/new` and `/reset` turns are the exception: the runtime can prepend recent daily memory as a one-shot startup-context block for that first turn.
</Note>

Large files are truncated with a marker. The max per-file size is controlled by
`agents.defaults.bootstrapMaxChars` (default: 20000). Total injected bootstrap
content across files is capped by `agents.defaults.bootstrapTotalMaxChars`
(default: 60000). Missing files inject a short missing-file marker. When truncation
occurs, OpenClaw can inject a concise system-prompt warning notice; control this with
`agents.defaults.bootstrapPromptTruncationWarning` (`off`, `once`, `always`;
default: `always`). Detailed raw/injected counts stay in diagnostics such as
`/context`, `/status`, doctor, and logs.

For memory files, truncation is not data loss: the file remains intact on disk.
On native Codex, `MEMORY.md` is read on demand through memory tools when
available, with bounded prompt fallback when tools cannot run. On other
harnesses, the model only sees the shortened injected copy until it reads or
searches memory directly. If `MEMORY.md` is repeatedly truncated there, distill
it into a shorter durable summary and move detailed history into `memory/*.md`,
or intentionally raise the bootstrap limits.

Sub-agent sessions only inject `AGENTS.md` and `TOOLS.md` (other bootstrap files
are filtered out to keep the sub-agent context small).

Internal hooks can intercept this step via `agent:bootstrap` to mutate or replace
the injected bootstrap files (for example swapping `SOUL.md` for an alternate persona).

If you want to make the agent sound less generic, start with
[SOUL.md Personality Guide](/concepts/soul).

To inspect how much each injected file contributes (raw vs injected, truncation, plus tool schema overhead), use `/context list` or `/context detail`. See [Context](/concepts/context).

## Time handling

The system prompt includes a dedicated **Current Date & Time** section when the
user timezone is known. To keep the prompt cache-stable, it now only includes
the **time zone** (no dynamic clock or time format).

Use `session_status` when the agent needs the current time; the status card
includes a timestamp line. The same tool can optionally set a per-session model
override (`model=default` clears it).

Configure with:

- `agents.defaults.userTimezone`
- `agents.defaults.timeFormat` (`auto` | `12` | `24`)

See [Date & Time](/date-time) for full behavior details.

## Skills

When eligible skills exist, OpenClaw injects a compact **available skills list**
(`formatSkillsForPrompt`) that includes the **file path** for each skill. The
prompt instructs the model to use `read` to load the SKILL.md at the listed
location (workspace, managed, or bundled). If no skills are eligible, the
Skills section is omitted.

Native Codex turns receive this list as turn-scoped collaboration developer
instructions instead of per-turn user input, except lightweight cron turns that
preserve the exact scheduled prompt. Other harnesses keep the normal prompt
section.

The location can point at a nested skill, such as
`skills/personal/foo/SKILL.md`. Nesting is only organizational; the prompt still
uses the flat skill name from `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

Eligibility includes skill metadata gates, runtime environment/config checks,
and the effective agent skill allowlist when `agents.defaults.skills` or
`agents.list[].skills` is configured.

Plugin-bundled skills are eligible only when their owning plugin is enabled.
This lets tool plugins expose deeper operating guides without embedding all of
that guidance directly in every tool description.

```
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>...</name>
    <description>...</description>
    <location>...</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

This keeps the base prompt small while still enabling targeted skill usage.

The skills list budget is owned by the skills subsystem:

- Global default: `skills.limits.maxSkillsPromptChars`
- Per-agent override: `agents.list[].skillsLimits.maxSkillsPromptChars`

Generic bounded runtime excerpts use a different surface:

- `agents.defaults.contextLimits.*`
- `agents.list[].contextLimits.*`

That split keeps skills sizing separate from runtime read/injection sizing such
as `memory_get`, live tool results, and post-compaction AGENTS.md refreshes.

## Documentation

The system prompt includes a **Documentation** section. When local docs are available, it
points to the local OpenClaw docs directory (`docs/` in a Git checkout or the bundled npm
package docs). If local docs are unavailable, it falls back to
[https://docs.openclaw.ai](https://docs.openclaw.ai).

The same section also includes the OpenClaw source location. Git checkouts expose the local
source root so the agent can inspect code directly. Package installs include the GitHub
source URL and tell the agent to review source there whenever the docs are incomplete or
stale. The prompt also notes the public docs mirror, community Discord, and ClawHub
([https://clawhub.ai](https://clawhub.ai)) for skills discovery. It tells the model to
consult docs first for OpenClaw behavior, commands, configuration, or architecture, and to
run `openclaw status` itself when possible (asking the user only when it lacks access).
For configuration specifically, it points agents to the `gateway` tool action
`config.schema.lookup` for exact field-level docs and constraints, then to
`docs/gateway/configuration.md` and `docs/gateway/configuration-reference.md`
for broader guidance.

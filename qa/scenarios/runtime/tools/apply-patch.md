# Apply patch runtime tool fixture

```yaml qa-scenario
id: runtime-tool-apply-patch
title: Runtime tool fixture — apply-patch
surface: runtime-tools
runtimeParityTier: standard
coverage:
  primary:
    - tools.apply-patch
objective: Verify apply_patch behavior is tracked across OpenClaw and Codex while Codex owns patching natively.
successCriteria:
  - OpenClaw may expose OpenClaw apply_patch while Codex app-server mode may omit duplicate OpenClaw dynamic apply_patch.
  - Mock provider apply_patch plans are reported as fixture intent, not as actual runtime tool calls.
  - The row stays report-only until fault injection uses valid patch-shaped inputs.

      action: fix fixture fault injection
      reason: Codex app-server intentionally owns apply_patch natively; this fixture still needs valid patch-shaped fault injection before it can prove product behavior.
    knownHarnessGap:
      issue: "#80320"
      reason: Codex-native apply_patch is intentionally not an OpenClaw dynamic tool; QA fault injection still uses synthetic failure-path inputs.

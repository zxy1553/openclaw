## Safety model

`openclaw migrate` is preview-first.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Preview before apply">
    The provider returns an itemized plan before anything changes, including conflicts, skipped items, and sensitive items. JSON plans, apply output, and migration reports redact nested secret-looking keys such as API keys, tokens, authorization headers, cookies, and passwords.

    `openclaw migrate apply <provider>` previews the plan and prompts before changing state unless `--yes` is set. In non-interactive mode, apply requires `--yes`.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Backups">
    Apply creates and verifies an OpenClaw backup before applying the migration. If no local OpenClaw state exists yet, the backup step is skipped and the migration can continue. To skip a backup when state exists, pass both `--no-backup` and `--force`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflicts">
    Apply refuses to continue when the plan has conflicts. Review the plan, then rerun with `--overwrite` if replacing existing targets is intentional. Providers may still write item-level backups for overwritten files in the migration report directory.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secrets">
    Interactive apply asks whether to import detected auth credentials, with yes selected by default. Use `--no-auth-credentials` to skip them, or use `--include-secrets` for unattended credential import with `--yes`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Claude provider

The bundled Claude provider detects Claude Code state at `~/.claude` by default. Use `--from <path>` to import a specific Claude Code home or project root.

<Tip>
For a user-facing walkthrough, see [Migrating from Claude](/install/migrating-claude).
</Tip>

### What Claude imports

- Project `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` into the OpenClaw agent workspace.
- User `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` appended to workspace `USER.md`.
- MCP server definitions from project `.mcp.json`, Claude Code `~/.claude.json`, and Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- Claude skill directories that include `SKILL.md`.
- Claude command Markdown files converted into OpenClaw skills with manual invocation only.

### Archive and manual-review state

Claude hooks, permissions, environment defaults, local memory, path-scoped rules, subagents, caches, plans, and project history are preserved in the migration report or reported as manual-review items. OpenClaw does not execute hooks, copy broad allowlists, or import OAuth/Desktop credential state automatically.

## Codex provider

The bundled Codex provider detects Codex CLI state at `~/.codex` by default, or
at `CODEX_HOME` when that environment variable is set. Use `--from <path>` to
inventory a specific Codex home.

Use this provider when moving to the OpenClaw Codex harness and you want to
promote useful personal Codex CLI assets deliberately. Local Codex app-server
launches use a per-agent `CODEX_HOME`, so they do not read your personal
`~/.codex` by default. The normal process `HOME` is still inherited, so Codex
can see shared `$HOME/.agents/*` skills/plugin marketplace entries and
subprocesses can find user-home config and tokens.

Running `openclaw migrate codex` in an interactive terminal previews the full
plan, then opens checkbox selectors before the final apply confirmation. Skill
copy items are prompted first. Use `Toggle all on` or `Toggle all off` for bulk
selection. Press Space to toggle rows, or press Enter to activate the highlighted
row and continue. Planned skills start checked, conflict skills start unchecked, and
`Skip for now` skips skill copies for this run while still continuing to plugin
selection. When source-installed curated Codex plugins are migratable and
`--plugin` was not supplied, migration then prompts for native Codex plugin
activation by plugin name. Plugin items
start checked unless the target OpenClaw Codex plugin config already has that
plugin. Existing target plugins start unchecked and show a conflict hint such as
`conflict: plugin exists`; choose `Toggle all off` to migrate no native Codex
plugins in that run, or `Skip for now` to stop before applying. For scripted or
exact runs, pass `--skill <name>` once per skill, for example:

```bash
openclaw migrate codex --dry-run --skill gog-vault77-google-workspace
openclaw migrate apply codex --yes --skill gog-vault77-google-workspace
```

Use `--plugin <name>` to limit native Codex plugin migration non-interactively
to one or more source-installed curated plugins:

```bash
openclaw migrate codex --dry-run --plugin google-calendar
openclaw migrate apply codex --yes --plugin google-calendar
```

### What Codex imports

- Codex CLI skill directories under `$CODEX_HOME/skills`, excluding Codex's
  `.system` cache.
- Personal AgentSkills under `$HOME/.agents/skills`, copied into the current
  OpenClaw agent workspace when you want per-agent ownership.
- Source-installed `openai-curated` Codex plugins discovered through Codex
  app-server `plugin/list`. Planning reads `plugin/read` for each enabled
  installed plugin. App-backed plugins require the source Codex app-server
  account response to be a ChatGPT subscription account; non-ChatGPT or missing
  account responses are skipped with `codex_subscription_required`. By default,
  migration does not call source `app/list`, so app-backed plugins that pass the
  account gate are planned without source app accessibility verification, and
  account lookup transport failures skip with `codex_account_unavailable`. Pass
  `--verify-plugin-apps` when you want migration to force a fresh source
  `app/list` snapshot and require every owned app to be present, enabled, and
  accessible before planning native activation. In that mode, account lookup
  transport failures fall through to source app inventory verification. The
  source app inventory snapshot is kept in memory for the current process; it
  is not written to migration output or target config. Disabled plugins,
  unreadable plugin details, subscription-gated source accounts, and, when
  verification is requested, missing apps, disabled apps, inaccessible apps, or
  source app inventory failures become manual skipped items with typed reasons
  instead of target config entries.
  Apply calls app-server `plugin/install` for each selected eligible plugin,
  even if the target app-server already reports that plugin as installed and
  enabled. Migrated Codex plugins are usable only in sessions that select the
  native Codex harness; they are not exposed to OpenClaw provider runs,
  ACP conversation bindings, or other harnesses.

### Manual-review Codex state

Codex `config.toml`, native `hooks/hooks.json`, non-curated marketplaces, cached
plugin bundles that are not source-installed curated plugins, and source-installed
plugins that fail the source subscription gate are not activated automatically.
When `--verify-plugin-apps` is set, plugins that fail the source app-inventory
gate are also skipped. They are copied or reported in the migration report for
manual review.

For migrated source-installed curated plugins, apply writes:

- `plugins.entries.codex.enabled: true`
- `plugins.entries.codex.config.codexPlugins.enabled: true`
- `plugins.entries.codex.config.codexPlugins.allow_destructive_actions: true`
- one explicit plugin entry with `marketplaceName: "openai-curated"` and
  `pluginName` for each selected plugin

Migration never writes `plugins["*"]` and never stores local marketplace cache
paths. Source-side subscription failures are reported on manual items with typed
reasons such as `codex_subscription_required`, `codex_account_unavailable`,
`plugin_disabled`, or `plugin_read_unavailable`. With `--verify-plugin-apps`,
source app-inventory failures can also appear as `app_inaccessible`,
`app_disabled`, `app_missing`, or `app_inventory_unavailable`. Skipped plugins
are not written to target config.
Target-side auth-required installs are reported on the affected plugin item with
`status: "skipped"`, `reason: "auth_required"`, and sanitized app identifiers.
Their explicit config entries are written disabled until you reauthorize and
enable them. Other install failures are item-scoped `error` results.

The native Codex plugin config also accepts first-party `openai-bundled` and
`openai-primary-runtime` marketplace identities, but migration does not
auto-discover or install them from source state.

OpenAI-side app/plugin availability still comes from the signed-in Codex
account and workspace app controls. See
[Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan)
for OpenAI's account and workspace-control overview, then use
[Native Codex plugins](/plugins/codex-native-plugins#manual-first-party-marketplace-entries)
for manual first-party marketplace entries.

If Codex app-server plugin inventory is unavailable during planning, migration
falls back to cached bundle advisory items instead of failing the whole
migration.

## Hermes provider

The bundled Hermes provider detects state at `~/.hermes` by default. Use `--from <path>` when Hermes lives elsewhere.

### What Hermes imports

- Default model configuration from `config.yaml`.
- Configured model providers and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints from `providers` and `custom_providers`.
- MCP server definitions from `mcp_servers` or `mcp.servers`.
- `SOUL.md` and `AGENTS.md` into the OpenClaw agent workspace.
- `memories/MEMORY.md` and `memories/USER.md` appended to workspace memory files.
- Memory config defaults for OpenClaw file memory, plus archive or manual-review items for external memory providers such as Honcho.
- Skills that include a `SKILL.md` file under `skills/<name>/`.
- Per-skill config values from `skills.config`.
- OpenCode OpenAI OAuth credentials from OpenCode `auth.json` when interactive credential migration is accepted, or when `--include-secrets` is set. Hermes `auth.json` OAuth entries are legacy state reported for manual OpenAI reauth or doctor repair.
- Supported API keys and tokens from Hermes `.env` and OpenCode `auth.json` when interactive credential migration is accepted, or when `--include-secrets` is set.

### Supported `.env` keys

- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
- `ALIBABA_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `ARCEEAI_API_KEY`
- `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`

- `XIAOMI_API_KEY`
- `ZAI_API_KEY`
- `Z_AI_API_KEY`

### Archive-only state

Hermes state that OpenClaw cannot safely interpret is copied into the migration report for manual review, but it is not loaded into live OpenClaw config or credentials. This preserves opaque or unsafe state without pretending OpenClaw can execute or trust it automatically:

- `plugins/`
- `sessions/`
- `logs/`
- `cron/`
- `mcp-tokens/`
- `state.db`

### After applying

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

## Plugin contract

Migration sources are plugins. A plugin declares its provider ids in `openclaw.plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "migrationProviders": ["hermes"]
  }
}
```

At runtime the plugin calls `api.registerMigrationProvider(...)`. The provider implements `detect`, `plan`, and `apply`. Core owns CLI orchestration, backup policy, prompts, JSON output, and conflict preflight. Core passes the reviewed plan into `apply(ctx, plan)`, and providers may rebuild the plan only when that argument is absent for compatibility.

Provider plugins can use `openclaw/plugin-sdk/migration` for item construction and summary counts, plus `openclaw/plugin-sdk/migration-runtime` for conflict-aware file copies, archive-only report copies, cached config-runtime wrappers, and migration reports.

## Onboarding integration

Onboarding can offer migration when a provider detects a known source. Both `openclaw onboard --flow import` and `openclaw setup --wizard --import-from hermes` use the same plugin migration provider and still show a preview before applying.

<Note>
Onboarding imports require a fresh OpenClaw setup. Reset config, credentials, sessions, and the workspace first if you already have local state. Backup-plus-overwrite or merge imports are feature-gated for existing setups.
